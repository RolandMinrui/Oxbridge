"The CPI in May was -0.1% month-on-month, which was higher than the -0.2% average for the same month in the past 10 years (2014 to 2023). At the same time, the core CPI in May was -0.2% month-on-month, which was lower than the +0.1% average for the same month over the past 10 years. , 5 shows that after excluding food and energy, the CPI in May was weaker than seasonally. Combined with the fact that the month-on-month fuel consumption for transportation in May was lower than the average of the same month in the past 10 years, while the month-on-month food CPI was significantly higher than the average of the past 10 years, it can be found that the core support for the month-on-month CPI to surpass the seasonality in May is the rapid recovery of food prices.

"In order to further improve the normalized dividend distribution mechanism of listed companies and improve the level of investor returns, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, based on regulatory practices, has issued the """"Regulatory Guidelines for Listed Companies No. 3 - Cash Dividends by Listed Companies"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines""""), and The """"Guidelines on the Articles of Association of Listed Companies"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Guidelines on the Articles of Association"""") have revised the relevant provisions on cash dividends and are now soliciting opinions from the public. Continuous and stable dividends help enhance investor returns, promote the establishment of a peaceful investment philosophy, and promote the stable and healthy development of the market. It also helps reduce the company\'s redundant funds, improve the efficiency of asset use, and guide the company to focus on its main business. Since the promulgation and implementation of the current """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""" and """"Articles of Association Guidelines"""", they have played an important role in improving the internal governance mechanism and external regulatory constraints on dividends, and the dividend situation of A-share listed companies has continued to improve. In the past five years, A-share listed companies have paid a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the annual dividend amount has begun to exceed the equity financing amount of the year. Among them, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies paid cash dividends in 2022, with a dividend amount of 2.1 trillion yuan, of which 1.6 trillion yuan was distributed to domestic investors, a year-on-year increase of 22.7%, and the number of dividend payers accounted for 67.1%. The dividend payout rate (32.5%) and dividend rate (1.97%) are in the middle and upper reaches compared with major global capital markets. First, the scale of dividends has grown rapidly. The average annual growth rate of dividends over the past ten years has been 13.3%, which is higher than the growth rate of net profit in the same period (about 10%). Second, the habit of paying dividends has gradually developed. The proportion of companies paying dividends has increased from about 50% ten years ago to about 70%. The proportion of companies paying dividends for five consecutive years has increased from 20% to 48%. Third, the dividend characteristics are generally consistent with the development stage of the company, and the dividend levels of companies in different sectors and industries vary. However, compared with mature overseas markets, the balance, timeliness, and stability of dividends need to be further improved, and investors\' sense of gain needs to be enhanced. There are also some companies that pay abnormally high proportions of dividends, which may damage their solvency and ability to continue operating. It needs to be promptly Guide regulations The main idea of \u200b\u200bthis revision of cash dividend rules is to encourage companies to formulate clear dividend policies in their articles of association on the basis of adhering to corporate autonomy, and to stabilize investors\' dividend expectations. For companies that do not pay dividends and have large financial investments but low dividend ratios , urge dividends by strengthening disclosure requirements; facilitate the company\'s mid-term dividend implementation procedures, encourage companies to increase the frequency of cash dividends; strengthen the constraints on companies with abnormally high proportions of dividends, and guide reasonable dividends The revision of the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""" mainly includes three aspects: First, it further clarifies the orientation of encouraging cash dividends and promotes an increase in the level of dividends. Strengthen disclosure requirements and other institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends and urge them to pay dividends Pay special attention to companies with large financial investments but low dividend levels, urge them to increase their dividend levels, and focus on their main business The second is to simplify the mid-term dividend distribution process and promote further optimization of the dividend method and rhythm. Encourage companies to increase the frequency of dividends when conditions permit. In combination with regulatory practices, listed companies are allowed to review and approve the conditions and upper limits for mid-term cash dividends for the next year within a certain amount when convening annual shareholders\' meetings to review annual profit distribution plans, so as to facilitate companies to further Increase the frequency of dividends, allowing investors to better plan capital arrangements and share corporate growth dividends earlier The third is to strengthen the constraints on companies that pay abnormally high proportions of dividends and guide reasonable dividend distribution It is emphasized that when listed companies formulate cash dividend policies, they should comprehensively consider their own profitability, capital expenditure arrangements and debt repayment capabilities, as well as investor returns and company development. Pay close attention to companies with high asset-liability ratios, poor cash flows from operating activities, and large proportions of cash dividends to prevent adverse effects on the company\'s production, operations, and debt repayment capabilities. The relevant provisions of the """"Guidelines for the Articles of Association of Listed Companies"""" have been revised in three main aspects: First, listed companies are encouraged to increase the frequency of cash dividends under the conditions of profit distribution, guide the formation of mid-term dividend distribution habits, and stabilize investors\' dividend expectations Second, in accordance with the institutional arrangements for optimizing the implementation procedures for interim cash dividends in the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""", new requirements for the completion time limit for interim dividends have been added. The third is to urge companies to refine dividend policies in their articles of association, clarify the goals of cash dividends, and better stabilize investor expectations. At the same time, companies should be guided to formulate dividend restriction clauses in their articles of association to prevent companies from enlarging the risk of dividends when profits are unreal and debts are too high. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will simultaneously revise and improve the standardized operation guidelines for listed companies and clarify operational requirements. In the next step, the China Securities Regulatory Commission will further improve the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""" and """"Articles of Association Guidelines"""" based on the public solicitation of opinions, and issue and implement them as soon as possible",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive

"A brief review of U.S. third quarter GDP data. In the third quarter of 2023, the US GDP annualized rate was 4.9%, which was significantly higher than the previous value of 2.1%, better than the expected 4.5%, and lower than the 5.4% predicted by GDPNow. From the perspective of month-on-month growth: 1) Personal consumption is the largest contributor (2.69 percentage points). Spending on services grew strongly (1.62 percentage points), led by rent and health care spending. 2) Private investment is a secondary contribution (1.47 percentage points), of which changes in private inventories drove 1.32 percentage points month-on-month, and residential investment achieved positive growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2021, driving 0.15 percentage points month-on-month. 3) Government expenditure contributed 0.79 percentage points, and the contribution of defense expenditure increased significantly. After the GDP data was released, the market reaction was slightly negative due to geopolitical drag, with the three major U.S. stock indexes falling and the 10-year U.S. bond interest rate falling. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we predict that the U.S. economy may still maintain positive growth of about 1%, and then the full-year growth may reach more than 2.5%, basically the same as before the epidemic. Looking forward, if personal consumption data remains strong, geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East expand, and the job market continues to be tight, the Fed may still choose to tighten further.

"The consumer price index (CPI) is a relative number that measures the price level of consumer goods and services over time, reflecting the trend and degree of change in the price level of goods and services purchased by residents. Its annual rate of change is often used to reflect the extent of inflation or deflation; The CPI and its sub-indices are also an important reference for calculating GDP and the real value of assets, liabilities, consumption, and income. The compilation method of CPI is to select representative specifications among many measurement objects, collect their price data, calculate the average price and individual price index of these representative specifications, and then use the geometric average to calculate the basic classification price index, and then use the weighted average method to calculate the price index of small classes, medium classes and major categories step by step, until the total price index. According to the interpretation of the CPI indicator by the National Bureau of Statistics, the calculation process is as follows: First, the National Bureau of Statistics and local statistical offices determine the items of goods and services used to calculate the CPI, as well as the survey outlets. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has uniformly determined the categories of goods and services based on the sample survey data of urban and rural residents' household consumption expenditures across the country, and has set up 268 basic categories including food, tobacco and alcohol, clothing, housing, daily necessities and services, transportation and communications, education, culture and entertainment, medical care, and other supplies and services, which basically cover all the consumption content of urban and rural residents. About 500 cities and counties across the country were selected to determine the survey outlets for collecting prices, including grocery stores, department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, specialized markets, specialty stores, shopping centers, farmers' markets, and service consumption units, totaling 63,000. Secondly, in accordance with the method of """"""""assigning people, fixed points, and timing"""""""", the statistical department sends investigators to the survey outlets to collect prices on the spot. At present, there are about 4,000 price investigators in 500 survey cities and counties in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country. The frequency of price collection varies from commodity to commodity, and the price of grain, pork, beef and mutton, vegetables and other foods in the CPI that are closely related to residents' lives and have relatively frequent price changes are investigated every 5 days; For most industrial products such as clothing, shoes and hats, consumer durables, transportation and communication tools, the price is surveyed 2-3 times a month; For water, electricity and other government pricing items, the price is investigated and verified once a month. Finally, the price index of a single item of goods or services and 268 basic categories is calculated based on the original price information after review. Then, according to the corresponding weights of each category, the category price index and CPI are calculated. The weights in China's CPI are mainly determined according to the detailed proportion of the consumption expenditure of various goods and services of urban and rural households across the country. The CPI summary calculation method adopts a chain pull formula, which compiles month-on-month, month-on-month and fixed-base price indexes. The CPI is equal to 100, indicating that there is no change in the comprehensive price in the reporting period compared with the base period; If the consumer price index is greater than 100, it means that the comprehensive price has increased compared with the base period in the reporting period, and the higher the price index, the more the price has risen. If the consumer price index is less than 100, it indicates that the comprehensive price of goods decreased in the reporting period compared with the base period.",neutral,Neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral

It is worth noting that our interest rate forecast is based on the basic assumption that the US economy will enter a soft landing next. If the US non-farm payroll data deteriorates sharply again in August and the US economy is at risk of falling into recession, the Bank of Japan may be more cautious about its rate hike decision to prevent the Japanese economic growth rate from starting to decline under the circumstances of tighter monetary policy and weaker external demand.

In our opinion, neither is correct and is not applicable in this specific environment. Instead, deduction and first principles should be used.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"2. We must have determination, believe in common sense, and not be fooled by short-term phenomena. Much of the noise in the market is caused by liquidity, market structure, the emotions of market participants, and even market manipulation. The power of hedge funds and quantitative funds in the U.S. stock market is very powerful and can create a lot of noise and panic in the short term, causing some timid investors to panic and cut their stocks out in order to achieve the purpose of short selling profits. In the past year, we can see the shadow of hedge fund manipulation in the stock prices of Apple, Tesla, and Netflix.",neutral,neutral,Negative,neutral,negative,3. negative
"4. The evolution of the business cycle is often not linear, so it cannot be simply linearly extrapolated. At this point in time, the Republican Party, which has long neglected its duties, has begun to resume its normal budget watchdog function under the leadership of the new speaker, and closes the large-scale water pipes of the Democratic Party, and the fiscal stimulus will be at the end of the war. Therefore, coupled with the high degree of tightening of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, it may cause the U.S. economy to slow down or even turn into autumn overnight. This slowdown may be a sudden slowdown, and the disease may come like a mountain.",negative,negative,Negative,negative,negative, negative
"The Treasury is a big player in influencing interest rates. Yellen was criticized by Drukenmiller, a partner of Soros, who believed that she was incompetent and did not issue more debt when long-term interest rates were low. As a result, she was forced to issue debt when interest rates are now high, resulting in increased interest expenses. This criticism is reasonable because Yellen is an economist whose style is more academic than practical. In fact, the Biden administration does not take Yellen's opinions and views seriously, and treats her more like a flower vase. Yellen probably did not expect that the Biden administration would continue to borrow without a bottom line.",negative,negative,Negative,negative,positive, negative
"However, the criticism is obviously effective. The Ministry of Finance announced the financing plan for the fourth quarter. The overall scale was lower than expected, with a reduction of US$76 billion. The balance of the Treasury Department's account is also very high, exceeding the pre-epidemic level, about more than 750 billion U.S. dollars, reducing the need for subsequent bond issuance. The direct consequence of this news is that long-term bond interest rates in the United States continue to fall, because there are many shorts to cover. The Ministry of Finance also plans to restart the debt buyback plan in 2024 to improve the debt structure and borrow more low-interest debt to repay high interest rates.",positive,neutral,Neutral,negative,positive,1. negative
"The Federal Reserve also had an important event last Wednesday. The result of the November interest rate meeting was to suspend interest rate hikes. Powell also did not discuss the possibility of raising interest rates one more time, suggesting that there will be no rate hike in December. After all, long-term bond interest rates have soared and financial conditions have tightened, which is equivalent to raising interest rates twice. The futures market expects that the probability of an interest rate hike in December is around 10%, and interest rate cuts will probably begin in May or June next year, with a 100 basis point rate cut throughout the year. But we should also note that the expectations of the futures market may be too optimistic.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive,0.0

The general public budget and government fund budget revenue are both negative, mainly related to the decrease in government land sales revenue (-10.4 %); the cumulative growth rate of broad fiscal expenditures from January to April was -2.3%, a wider decline than the previous month, mainly due to the slow pace of special bond issuance since the beginning of the year. The issuance of new special bonds has been slow this year, with only 44% of actual issuances/planned issuances in April.

The Politburo meeting on April 30 stated that it is necessary to issue and make good use of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds as soon as possible, speed up the issuance and use of special bonds, and maintain necessary fiscal expenditure intensity. However, judging from the special treasury bond issuance plan announced by the Ministry of Finance on May 13, the issuance of 1 trillion ultra-long special treasury bonds is relatively scattered from May to November, and the number of issuances from June to October is relatively large.

"This round of RMB appreciation at the end of 2023 has a different flavor. How big will this round of exchange rate appreciation be? Why did the appreciation of the exchange rate not bring about a rise in the stock market? Let’s start with these two issues to analyze the new changes in exchange rates in recent years, and look forward to 2024 based on these changes. For the first question, our answer may be different from what seems intuitive - the RMB\'s increase may be too large, and this is also the answer to the second question.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive,2. neutral
"To understand the logic behind it, we believe that the core reason is the stronger policy attribute of the exchange rate this year. Related to this, there are three profound changes worthy of attention: the rise in the attribute of """"policy bottom"""", the deepening of the brand of """"financing currency"""" and the """"economic stabilizer"""" """"The function is weakened. We believe that under these three changes, it is very likely that the RMB exchange rate will break 7 next year, but this is not necessarily good news for the economy and the market.",neutral,negative,Negative,neutral,negative,7.0
"Looking forward to 2024, the biggest uncertainty in the exchange rate comes from policy demands. Under the base case, we believe that the RMB exchange rate: 1) will appreciate moderately throughout the year; 2) depreciation pressure will be greater in the first half of the year;",neutral,neutral,Neutral,positive,positive,1 neutral
"2) In terms of the overall rhythm, it shows the characteristics of """"high at the beginning and end of the year, low in the middle"""", and may rise above 7 in stages. However, if there is a strong demand for """"policy bottom"""", it may rise sharply above 7 in the first half of the year and turn to a sharp depreciation in the second half of the year.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive,7.0
"We believe that the important reason behind this is the competition between China and the United States, which has led to the exchange rate needing both a U.S. dollar anchor and a """"policy bottom."""" In our previous analysis framework, the U.S. dollar has always been an important benchmark for the RMB exchange rate. It is then fine-tuned based on imports, exports and cross-border capital flows, and the weight of the policy impact is relatively limited. But this will change in 2023, which will also have a profound impact on the exchange rate changes in 2024.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"The """"policy bottom"""" of the RMB exchange rate: the perspective of growth competition between China and the United States. This year may be the first year since China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 that the US dollar-denominated GDP growth rate has recorded a negative value. From the first three quarters, China’s US dollar-denominated GDP growth rate was about -2%, with the exchange rate depreciating. The range exceeds 6%. The direct result of this is that China\'s contribution to the global economy in 2023 will be less than that of the United States, or even less than that in 2022.",negative,neutral,Negative,negative,positive, negative
"Therefore, from this dimension we can obtain two standards for the """"policy bottom"""" of the RMB exchange rate. The low standard may ensure that the US dollar-denominated GDP growth rate is higher than 0, while the high standard may ensure that China’s contribution to the global economy is no less than that of the United States. Calculated by a low standard, the average depreciation rate of the US dollar against the RMB in 2024 should not be higher than the nominal GDP growth rate. We predict that China\'s nominal GDP growth rate in 2024 may be 5.2%, and the corresponding depreciation bottom line of the RMB exchange rate is 7.45. According to high standards, the IMF predicts that the US nominal GDP growth rate in 2024 will be about 3.8%, which corresponds to China\'s economic growth rate of 5.9%. This requires an additional 0.7% appreciation of the RMB in 2024, and the corresponding bottom line of the RMB exchange rate is 7.03. Therefore, from this perspective, the policy may hope that the RMB will appreciate significantly.",neutral,Neutral,Positive,neutral,positive, positive
"It is worth noting that an important logic behind this is that the better the U.S. economy is and the weaker our country\'s economy is, the greater the need to stabilize the exchange rate, especially as the efficiency of domestic economic stabilization policies has declined in recent years. This will not only prevent the exchange rate from functioning as an """"automatic stabilizer"""" for the economy, but will also limit the space for countercyclical adjustment of monetary policy, especially interest rate policy (we will explain the impact on monetary policy in more detail in subsequent reports).",negative,neutral,Neutral,negative,positive, negative
"When the former is combined with the """"new normal"""" of inverted interest rate differentials between China and the United States, it will lead to the rise of the """"financing currency"""" attribute of the RMB and the rise of carry trade. Simply put, investors tend to sell low-cost, low-volatility assets while buying high-yielding assets, thereby obtaining more stable positive returns. A typical example is the Japanese yen. International investors were once keen to borrow Japanese yen to purchase other relatively high-interest assets, such as U.S. debt.",neutral,neutral,Positive,neutral,positive, positive
"The rise of this carry trade also means the continuous accumulation of """"natural"""" short positions. The disadvantage is that currencies are very sensitive to interest rates and liquidity environments at home and abroad. If we pay attention to the exchange rate, domestic monetary policy, especially interest rate cuts, will be greatly constrained.",negative,neutral,Negative,negative,neural, negative
"This year, the characteristics of RMB as a financing currency have become increasingly obvious. We usually use the """"interest spread/volatility"""" indicator to measure whether a currency is suitable as a financing currency in carry transactions - generally the larger the interest rate spread relative to other currencies and the smaller the volatility, the better. , the greater the negative value of this indicator, the more prominent the characteristics of RMB as a financing currency.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"Two major changes in monetary policy this year are related to this. The first is to be more """"stingy"""" with interest rate cuts. In the third quarter of this year, when the economy is under the greatest pressure, it only cut interest rates by 15bp (MLF interest rate), causing the actual interest rate to rise this year. The second is to be more vigilant about """"idling of funds"""", and the risk of idling of funds and interest rate fluctuations. The decline (we use the difference between DR007 and the reverse repurchase rate to measure) will amplify the depreciation pressure of the RMB. After August this year, the central bank and other regulatory agencies have significantly strengthened the governance of this phenomenon. This is reflected in the fact that although liquidity has not been reduced, However, the currency market continues to be tight.

"From a market perspective, the central decline of the US dollar determines the basic direction of the RMB.

After the epidemic, especially since 2022, the economic pattern of """"the United States is relatively strong, Europe and China are relatively weak"""" and the tight global liquidity situation will not fundamentally change in 2024: both the Chinese and European economies are facing transformation.

"A rate cut by the Fed has never been a sufficient condition for a sharp depreciation of the dollar. Exchange rates have always been a relative concept. When looking forward to the Fed\'s interest rate cuts, don\'t forget that from a fundamental perspective, China and Europe may have greater urgency to cut interest rates and ease in 2024. A typical example is 2019. Against the background of the global economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in the second half of 2019, and the US dollar continued to appreciate throughout the year.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,negative,positive,2019

"The pace of interest rate cuts in China and the United States will become an important factor affecting the periodic appreciation and depreciation of the RMB.

"The pace of interest rate cuts that is more comfortable for the exchange rate in 2024 may be to follow the Fed\'s operations.

"First, the rebound is improving. In terms of economic growth, china\'s GDP exceeded 126 trillion yuan last year, and the growth rate was 2.2 percentage points faster than in 2022. Looking at the quarters, it shows a trend of low in the first, high in the middle, and stable in the end, and the good trend is further consolidated.

The whole country focused on the primary task of high-quality development to promote the economy to continuously gain advantages in structural adjustment, transformation and upgrading, and to achieve more high-quality development.

At the same time, despite the expected decline in global trade, china\'s exports have also achieved slight growth, and their share of the global market has remained stable. Another point is that the overall price increase is moderate, which is in sharp contrast to the high global inflation and the difficult balance between anti-inflation and stabilizing growth in some countries.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive

I would like to ask the publisher to introduce the contribution rate and pulling point of the three major demands to economic growth in the fourth quarter and the whole year of 2023? Are there any new changes? I would also like to know how the domestic and international dual circulation pattern has developed over the past year. Thanks.,neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"Thank you for your question. You are concerned about two issues, one is the three major demand situations, and the other is the double cycle situation. First of all, to answer your first question, the contribution and pull of the three major needs. In 2023, final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, and net exports of goods and services will drive economic growth by 4.3, 1.5, and -0.6 percentage points respectively, and their contribution rates to economic growth will be 82.5%, 28.9%, and -11.4% respectively. In the fourth quarter, final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, and net exports of goods and services drove economic growth by 4.2, 1.2, and -0.2 percentage points respectively, and contributed 80%, 23.1%, and -3.1% to economic growth respectively.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive,4.2
"First, the main role of the domestic circulation is increasing. Based on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand and releasing the potential of the strong domestic demand market, the role of domestic circulation in driving economic development has been significantly enhanced. In 2023, china\'s total retail sales of consumer goods will reach 47.1 trillion yuan, and the scale of fixed asset investment will be 50.3 trillion yuan. The contribution rate of domestic demand to economic growth will reach 111.4%, an increase of 25.3 percentage points from the previous year. We are working hard to build a unified national market, open up the blockages in the domestic circulation, and smooth all links of production, distribution, circulation and consumption. The flow of factors has also become more active, and the connection between production and marketing is gradually improving. In the fourth quarter, the industrial capacity utilization rate above designated size was 75.9%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points year-on-year; the product sales rate of industrial enterprises above designated size remained stable at a level of above 97%. The annual operating freight volume increased by 8.2%, and the operating passenger volume increased by 66.5% year-on-year.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Second, the quality and level of international circulation have been further improved. Faced with adverse impacts such as shrinking external demand, china has stepped up its efforts to stabilize the scale and optimize the structure of foreign trade, and exports have achieved positive growth. The horizontal ratio is better than that of major export-oriented economies, and the share of the international market remains generally stable. In 2023, the export volume of goods will increase by 0.6% over the previous year, and the proportion of imports and exports of general trade and private enterprises will increase. At the same time, china is also actively expanding international economic and trade cooperation and jointly building the """"Belt and Road"""" with high quality. It has become a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, and the international circulation is wider and deeper. In 2023, china\'s total import and export volume to countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative increased by 2.8% compared with the previous year.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Third, domestic and international circulation reinforce each other. The advantages of our ultra-large-scale market have emerged, and the expansion of domestic demand has boosted imports. In 2023, the import value of agricultural products increased by 5% over the previous year, consumer goods increased by 1.2%, and energy product imports increased by 27.2%. The advantages of a sound industrial system and stable production capacity have also been brought into play. The stabilization and quality improvement of exports have brought about the development of related domestic industries and provided assistance to the overall improvement of the economy. In 2023, china\'s exports of goods will hit a new record high. Among them, exports of mechanical and electrical products increased by 2.9% over the previous year. The export volume of the """"three new"""" products represented by electric passenger vehicles, solar cells, and lithium-ion batteries also exceeded the one trillion yuan mark for the first time, with an increase of 29.9%.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive

Recent data shows that China’s CPI recorded negative growth for the third consecutive month in December. What is the outlook for CPI? Will the government take measures to combat low prices?,neutral,negative,Negative,negative,negative, negative
"Second, the decline in CPI is phased. In particular, china\'s economy is picking up and improving, residents\' income is growing steadily, domestic aggregate demand will also expand, and there are foundations and conditions for the rebound in prices of goods and services. As the Spring Festival holiday approaches recently, food consumption demand is also increasing. People are more active in consuming services such as dining out, visiting relatives and friends, and traveling. These will contribute to the seasonal recovery of CPI. Judging from the month-on-month situation, the CPI increased by 0.1% month-on-month in December 2023. In early January 2024, judging from the monitoring situation, some food prices remained stable and slightly increased. In addition, in addition to supply and demand, prices are also affected by expectations. Judging from the recent situation, the expected confidence of both enterprises and residents has recovered marginally. In December, the expected index of manufacturing production and operating activities reached 55.9%, and the expected index of non-manufacturing business activities reached 60.3%, both at a high level. boom range. In the fourth quarter, the prosperity index of enterprises above designated size was 109 points, 0.4 points higher than the previous quarter.

What measures will be taken in the future to continue to promote high-quality economic development? Thanks.,neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"Thank you for your question. High-quality development is the last word in the new era and the primary task of comprehensively building a modern socialist country. In 2023, all regions and departments have made great efforts to stabilize economic operations, and they have not relaxed their efforts in promoting high-quality development. Our country\'s economy has achieved effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth, and the road to high-quality development is on track. More determined, more powerful. To sum up, it can be summarized in five """"further steps"""".",positive,Positive,Positive,neutral,positive, positive
"First, important progress has been made in the construction of a modern industrial system, and the transformation of development momentum has been further accelerated. The modern industrial system is an important foundation for high-quality development. All regions and departments insist on scientific and technological innovation to lead the construction of a modern industrial system, and solidly promote the high-end, intelligent, and green transformation of the manufacturing industry. The new drivers and new advantages of china\'s economic development continue to grow, and modernization New progress has been made in the construction of industrial systems.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Second, reform and opening up have been advanced in depth, and development vitality has been further released. In 2023, our country will make every effort to promote the construction of a unified national market, optimize the development environment of the private economy, continue to create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, rule-by-law, and international, and effectively enhance the power and vitality of economic development. As of the end of September 2023, the number of registered business entities nationwide has reached 181 million, of which 122 million are individual industrial and commercial households. Accelerating the promotion of high-level opening up to the outside world, actively carrying out international economic and trade exchanges and cooperation, jointly building the """"Belt and Road"""" with high quality, successfully holding the China International Import Expo, the Fair for Trade in Services and the Canton Fair, china\'s import and export volume to countries co-building the """"Belt and Road"""" increased by 2.8% %. The annual intended transaction volume of the CIIE increased by 6.7% compared with the previous session.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Third, green and low-carbon transformation continues to deepen, and the development model further changes. Our country insists on promoting economic development in the green and low-carbon transformation, and the green production methods and lifestyles are accelerating the formation. Actively build a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system, and the energy consumption structure continues to be optimized. Preliminary calculations show that the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption in total energy consumption in 2023 will increase by 0.2 percentage points from the previous year. By the end of 2023, china\'s renewable energy power generation installed capacity will account for more than half of the total installed capacity, historically surpassing thermal power. The output of green and low-carbon products is also growing rapidly. In 2023, new energy vehicles will increase by 30.3% over the previous year, with production and sales ranking first in the world; exports of electric passenger vehicles will increase by 67.1%.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Fourth, people’s livelihood protection is strong and effective, and people’s lives have been further improved. Improving people\'s livelihood and well-being is the fundamental purpose of development. In 2023, the income of urban and rural residents will grow steadily, the level of public services and social security will continue to improve, and areas of shortcomings in people\'s livelihood will also gradually strengthen, further polishing the people\'s livelihood foundation for high-quality development. The per capita disposable income of residents increased by 6.1%, of which transfer payments such as social relief and subsidies from the government, policy living subsidies, and cash policy subsidies for farmers increased by 10.3%. Investment in people\'s livelihood continues to increase. Investment in the production and supply of electricity, heat, gas and water increased by 23%, and agricultural investment increased by 9.3%, both significantly faster than all investment.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Fifth, the ability to ensure food and energy security has been improved, and the foundation for safe development has been further consolidated. In 2023, our country has better ensured security in its development and achieved good development on the basis of security.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Of course, we must also realize that our country is still in a critical period of transforming its development model, optimizing its economic structure, and transforming its growth momentum. Many difficulties and challenges still need to be overcome to further promote high-quality development. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference, regard high-quality development as the last word in the new era, coordinate high-quality development and high-level security, continuously achieve effective improvement in economic quality and reasonable growth in quantity, and realize the grandiose goal of Chinese-style modernization. The blueprint becomes a beautiful reality step by step. Thanks.",neutral,neutral,neutral,positive,positive, positive
"I am also more concerned about structural issues. I would like to ask, how can we achieve the conversion of new and old driving forces in China\'s economic development? The report also shows that new energy vehicles and solar cells are growing rapidly. However, in the process of vigorously developing advanced manufacturing, how can we prevent possible overcapacity problems? In addition, with relatively insufficient domestic demand, will the rapid expansion of these industries bring downward pressure on prices and possible international trade frictions?

"Thank you for your question. Regarding the questions you mentioned, I would like to answer them mainly from two aspects:",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"First of all, the first point is about the conversion of old and new kinetic energy. High-quality development is development that implements new development concepts. Among the five major development concepts, """"innovation"""" ranks first. Adhering to innovation-driven and promoting the transformation of development momentum has always been an important task for high-quality development. Regardless of the adjustment and transformation of traditional momentum, China has been unswervingly promoting the transformation of old and new momentum. Just now, Director Kang Yi gave a detailed introduction to china’s achievements in high-quality development, especially innovation-driven development, last year. Here I will add a few more data. In 2023, the added value of china\'s equipment manufacturing industry above designated size increased by 6.8% over the previous year, playing a key role in promoting the stable recovery of industry; in 2023, a report released by the World Intellectual Property Organization showed that china\'s ranking in the Global Innovation Index rose to Ranked 12th, the number of the world\'s top 100 scientific and technological innovation clusters ranks first in the world for the first time. It can be said that new kinetic energy has become an important engine leading to high-quality development.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Secondly, last year, china\'s economy rebounded for the better, especially market demand and domestic demand, which recovered well. Everyone should have personal experience of this, especially as the driving role of demand has increased, the connection between china\'s supply and demand and the economic cycle have also improved. Continuously improving. Here are some data for your reference. In the fourth quarter, the product sales rate of china\'s industrial enterprises above designated size continued to remain above 97%, which rose to 98.4% in December; judging from the capacity utilization rate that reflects the status of production capacity utilization, in the four quarters of 2023, the industrial capacity utilization rate was respectively 74.3%, 74.5%, 75.6% and 75.9%, showing a trend of recovery quarter by quarter. This reflects that as market demand improves, China\'s production capacity utilization is gradually recovering. At the beginning of this year, we also noticed that ice and snow tourism, ice and snow sports, etc. can be said to be """"out of the circle"""". This not only conforms to the general trend of upgrading residents\' consumption structure, but also demonstrates the potential of china\'s domestic demand. We are optimistic about the recovery of the consumer market this year. Full of expectation and confidence.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Overall, our country is still in a critical period of economic recovery, transformation and upgrading. In the next step, we must follow the decisions and arrangements of the Central Economic Work Conference, persist in seeking progress while maintaining stability, promote stability by promoting stability, establish first and then break, continue to consolidate and enhance the positive trend of economic recovery, and promote the economy to achieve effective improvement in quality and reasonable growth in quantity. .

"What I want to ask is, last year we saw the impact of real estate on the entire macro economy. Can it remain stable this year? Thanks.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"Thank you for your question. Real estate has always attracted much attention. At my press conference last year, a reporter also mentioned this issue. Everyone is very concerned about how the trend is going and what the next step will be. According to our monitoring, after more than 20 years of development, the real estate market is in the process of adjustment and transformation. Against such a broad background, all regions and departments are adapting to the new situation of major changes in the supply and demand relationship in the real estate market, and are adjusting and optimizing real estate policies in a timely manner. Judging from the current situation, there have been some positive changes in the real estate market, mainly in two aspects:",positive,positive,positive,positive,positive, positive
"First, the decline in indicators such as real estate investment and sales narrowed. In 2023, real estate development investment will decrease by 9.6% compared with the previous year, and the decline will narrow by 0.4 percentage points compared with the previous year. The funds in place for real estate development enterprises fell by 13.6%, a decline that was 12.3 percentage points narrower than the previous year. The decline in commercial housing sales has significantly narrowed. In 2023, the sales area of \u200b\u200bcommercial housing nationwide will decrease by 8.5% compared with the previous year, and sales will decrease by 6.5%. Both are declining, but the declines are significantly narrowed by 15.8 and 20.2 percentage points respectively compared with the previous year. Since August, the number of online registrations for new commercial residential properties has rebounded overall, with an increase of 20.2 percentage points in December compared with August. According to the monitoring situation in 70 large and medium-sized cities, the transaction volume of new and second-hand houses is rising moderately. Second, the completed area of \u200b\u200breal estate has increased rapidly. The work of """"guaranteing the handover of buildings"""" is advancing steadily, and the results continue to show. In 2023, the area of \u200b\u200bcompleted housing by real estate development companies will increase by 17% compared with the previous year.",positive,neutral,Positive,negative,positive, positive
"Second, there is huge potential to build a new model of real estate development. A new model of real estate development is being actively constructed. This is a fundamental solution to solve real estate development problems and promote the healthy development of real estate. Among them, the construction of affordable housing, the construction of """"both leisure and emergency"""" public infrastructure, and the renovation of urban villages are all advancing rapidly. With the vigorous and orderly advancement of these projects, they will help solve the people\'s urgent, difficult and anxious problems in housing and living.

"Thank you for your question. How to view China\'s economic trend in 2024 is also a question of great concern to everyone. 2024 is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People\'s Republic of China. It is a critical year for us to implement the """"14th Five-Year Plan"""". To predict the economic trend of this year, we must first see that we will face some challenges and difficulties, but more are favorable conditions and advantages. Taken together, the opportunities we face outweigh the challenges, and the favorable conditions outweigh the unfavorable factors. The basic trend of long-term improvement of China\'s economy has not changed, and the factors and conditions supporting the high-quality development of China\'s economy are constantly accumulating and increasing. Therefore, we predict that China’s economy will continue to rebound and improve in 2024. Specifically, there are five favorable conditions.",positive,Positive,positive,positive,positive, positive
"First, economic growth has “good momentum.” In the four quarters of 2023, GDP has been growing positively year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, and the scale of the economy is also expanding quarter by quarter. This rebound is also relatively good. In addition to statistical accounting of economic aggregates, the National Bureau of Statistics also performs a task of monitoring and comparing some physical indicators. From the perspective of physical volume indicators, the absolute volume of most physical volume indicators such as electricity generation and consumption, output of major industrial products, investment, import and export, etc., greatly exceeded the level of 2019. Some physical volume indicators are lower than the pre-epidemic level in 2019, mainly due to the issue mentioned by the reporter just now, which is the output indicators of real estate-related products. This also reflects that our economic performance is improving as a whole. International organizations have raised their forecasts for china\'s economic growth. The International Monetary Fund has raised their forecasts by 0.4 percentage points, and the OECD has raised their forecasts by 0.1 percentage points. This shows that the international community is optimistic about China\'s economic development prospects in 2024.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Second, economic development is “resilient”. Our country has a strong industrial foundation. It is the only country that has all industrial categories in the United Nations industrial classification. The supporting capabilities and integration advantages of the industry are outstanding. The added value of our manufacturing industry accounts for nearly 1/3 of the world\'s total, and our exports of goods account for 1/3 of the world\'s total. The proportion of the world is 1/7. At the same time, china\'s infrastructure networks such as transportation and communications are increasingly improving, weak areas such as education and medical care are constantly being strengthened, and the quality of supply of factors such as talents and funds is significantly improved. Capacity building in critical areas such as food and energy security and industrial and supply chains has also achieved practical results. These have enhanced the resilience and room for maneuver of our country\'s economic development, and are also the foundation for the economy to be stable and long-term.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Third, high-quality development is “vital”. New industries are growing rapidly, new business formats are continuing to improve, new models are being cultivated at an accelerated pace, the economic structure is constantly being optimized, momentum is being transformed and upgraded, and the potential for economic development is expected to be further stimulated. In 2023, the added value of the service industry will account for 54.6% of the GDP, contributing more than 60% to economic growth. Investment in technological transformation in the manufacturing industry will increase by 3.8%, and investment in high-tech industries will increase by 10.3%, faster than all fixed assets. investment growth rate. More importantly, our country continues to promote a new situation of innovation-driven development, and the Chinese economy continues to grow and develop while accelerating the cultivation of new productive forces.",positive,Positive,positive,positive,positive, positive
"Fourth, reform and opening up has “many dividends”. Our country adheres to and improves the basic socialist economic system, adheres to the """"two unwavering principles"""", accelerates the construction of a unified national market, promotes the construction of a high-standard market system, optimizes the business environment, and creates a fairer competitive environment for all types of enterprises. These will continue to stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of business entities. Including foreign-invested enterprises. From January to November 2023, the number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises increased by 36.2% year-on-year, and the dividends of china\'s opening up continued to be released.",positive,Positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"Fifth, macroeconomic policies have “wide scope”. The effects of the policies introduced in 2023, such as additional issuance of government bonds, tax cuts and fee reductions, and interest rate cuts, will continue to be released this year. This year, some new measures will be reserved and optimized. These new incremental measures and existing policies will be combined to ensure the stable operation of the economy.

"Thank you for your question. The first question is about the performance of the consumer market in 2023, and the second question is about the prediction of the consumer market in 2024.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,neutral,positive, neutral
"Let me first introduce the performance of the consumer market in 2023. Generally speaking, the consumer market will recover in 2023. The consumer market has been greatly affected by the epidemic in the past three years, and many contact-based and gathering-based consumption have been suppressed. With the smooth transition of epidemic prevention and control, the economy and society have fully returned to normal operations, and consumption has shown a good recovery trend. Hotspots Frequently, consumption will become an important force driving economic recovery in 2023. There are several characteristics: First, the scale of consumption has reached a new high. In 2023, the total retail sales of consumer goods will exceed 47 trillion yuan, reaching a record high. Second, consumption has once again become the main driving force of economic growth. In 2023, final consumption expenditure will drive economic growth by 4.3 percentage points, an increase of 3.1 percentage points from the previous year, and its contribution to economic growth will be 82.5%, an increase of 43.1 percentage points. The basic role of consumption will become more significant. Third, service consumption recovered quickly. The rapid recovery of service consumption is also a highlight of consumption recovery in 2023. Service retail sales increased by 20% over the previous year, 14.2 percentage points faster than the retail sales of goods; residents’ per capita service consumption expenditure increased by 14.4%, accounting for 14.4% of residents’ per capita consumption. The proportion of expenditure reached 45.2%, an increase of 2 percentage points from the previous year. Fourth, the structural upgrading of residents’ consumption continues. In particular, with the improvement of people\'s living standards and the steady growth of income, our country is currently in a period of rapid upgrading of residents\' consumption structure.",positive,positive,Positive,positive,positive, positive
"What will happen in the next stage? We judge that there are many favorable conditions to support the continued recovery of consumption, and consumption will still maintain good growth. Supporting factors: First, the consumption potential is still huge. With a population of more than 1.4 billion, the advantages of the ultra-large-scale market are still obvious. In addition, the integrated development of urban and rural areas, the advancement of urbanization process, and the continuous upgrading of the consumption structure have provided broad space for consumption growth. In particular, the consumption potential of medical and health services is expected to be further unleashed. Second, the consumption base has been continuously consolidated. Income is the premise and foundation of consumption. As the economy continues to recover and the employment situation improves overall, residents\' income is expected to maintain steady growth, which will strongly support the improvement of residents\' consumption ability. Third, consumption highlights continue to emerge. Digital consumption, green consumption, health consumption, entertainment consumption, etc. are all developing rapidly, and consumption hot spots such as smart homes, entertainment and tourism, sports events, and domestic trendy products are also continuing to heat up, constantly adding impetus to the improvement and expansion of the consumer market. Fourth, policies to promote consumption continue to be implemented. All regions and departments insist on prioritizing the recovery and expansion of consumption, and have successively introduced a series of consumption-promoting policies, focusing on stabilizing and expanding traditional consumption, cultivating and strengthening new consumption, and continuing to optimize the consumption environment. They will continue to play a role in stabilizing the consumer market and promoting the recovery of consumption. to a positive effect. Therefore, we remain optimistic about consumption trends in 2024.
