"Core view: Over the past month, the changes in Japan's economic fundamentals have been mixed.

On the other hand, corporate-related economic indicators and foreign trade performed poorly, and the July inflation data has not yet reflected the positive impact of the sharp increase in wages in spring. Despite this, the Bank of Japan decided to raise interest rates in July beyond expectations. Based on its hawkish stance and the basic judgment of a soft landing for the US economy, we believe that Japan will still have one more interest rate hike this year, which may be realized as early as the October meeting. If the US economy enters a recession, the Bank of Japan may tend to stay put this year. In addition, we believe that we need to be wary of the risk that the Bank of Japan is too hawkish and causes the Japanese economy to stagnate.

In explaining the reason for the rate hike, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda pointed out that Japan's economy and prices improved as expected, while the rise in import prices caused by the weakening of the yen increased the risk of inflation. Interestingly, at the same time as the decision to raise interest rates, the Bank of Japan's economic forecast lowered the core CPI year-on-year inflation forecast for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points to 2.5%, but raised the forecast for 2025 by 0.2 percentage points to 2.1%.

In addition, the Bank of Japan lowered its economic growth forecast for this year by 0.2 percentage points to 0.6%, and maintained its outlook for 2025-2026 unchanged.

"Asset impact. In the context of 10-year U.S. bond interest rates remaining high, we are reminded of three market impacts: First, U.S. stock market volatility and adjustment pressure are on the rise. The current valuation of U.S. stocks is not low. As U.S. bond interest rates rise, the price-performance ratio of stocks and bonds is bound to decline; rising economic and policy uncertainty may curb stock market risk appetite. Second, the U.S. dollar index may remain relatively strong. The 10-year U.S. and German bond interest rate spread has exceeded the high in November 2022 (when the U.S. dollar index rose above 110). The recent rise in geopolitical risks and increased upward pressure on oil prices have weakened the economic growth prospects of Europe, Japan and other non-U.S. economies, further increasing the dollar index. Third, there may be a risk of a periodic correction in gold prices. If geopolitical conflicts do not expand beyond expectations, the price of gold may be more affected by the actual interest rate on U.S. debt and the U.S. dollar exchange rate.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,negative,positive, neutral

"Thank you for your question. The price issue is of great concern to all sectors of society. Judging from the overall situation in 2023, china\'s prices generally maintain a moderate upward trend, with the CPI rising by 0.2% throughout the year. As this reporter mentioned, CPI has been experiencing negative growth for three consecutive months. How to look at this issue? We look at the overall data, but also at the structural data. The year-on-year decline in CPI in the past few months is mainly structural and phased.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,negative,positive, negative
"First, let’s talk about structure first. The main factor in recent price declines is a fall in food and energy prices. If the impact of food and energy prices is excluded, the core CPI remains stable, which shows that this price decline is not universal and comprehensive, but local and structural. The decline in food and energy prices is not entirely a change in market supply and demand. Judging from the two years of 2022 and 2023, it is mainly affected by some non-economic and unconventional factors. Let\'s talk about energy first. Now energy prices, especially oil prices, have a larger weight in our country\'s CPI basket. Energy prices fell by 0.5% in December 2023, while they rose by 5.2% in the same period last year. As we all know, energy prices are mainly affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. Energy prices will rise sharply in 2022 and then fall back in 2023. One is positive and the other is negative, and the year-on-year downward pull is relatively large. Looking at food again, the price in December 2023 dropped by 3.7% year-on-year. In the same period last year, that is, in December 2022, it increased by 4.8%. Mainly affected by the epidemic in December 2022, logistics was not smooth, and the prices of various foods were rising. After normal operation was restored, supply was sufficient, and food prices naturally fell based on the high base of the previous year.",neutral,neutral,Neutral,negative,positive, negative
"Third, low prices also reflect problems such as insufficient effective demand to a certain extent. Insufficient effective demand is a phased phenomenon as the economy gradually returns to normal after our country has experienced three years of impact from the epidemic. Insufficient demand in the short term will lead to price declines. The central government attaches great importance to the problem of insufficient demand. When planning the economic work for 2024, the Central Economic Work Conference clearly emphasized that efforts should be made to expand domestic demand and promote consumption from post-epidemic recovery to sustained expansion, and clearly pointed out a series of specific work directions. With the introduction and implementation of these policies at the Central Economic Work Conference, the problem of insufficient effective demand will be gradually alleviated, and consumer prices are expected to stabilize and rise. We expect modest price increases in 2024. Thanks.",positive,neutral,neutral,positive,positive, positive

The urbanization rate has increased by an average annual rate of 0.93 percentage points in the past five years. More than 10 million rural residents will enter cities and towns every year. The scale of new citizens is relatively large, which will also bring a large demand for new housing. In terms of stock, although the per capita housing area in our country is already large, many houses have unreasonable functions and structures. Many people have an urgent need for improved housing. This will also form an important driving force for the real estate market, including those currently monitored.
