"The CPI in May was -0.1% month-on-month, which was higher than the -0.2% average for the same month in the past 10 years (2014 to 2023). At the same time, the core CPI in May was -0.2% month-on-month, which was lower than the +0.1% average for the same month over the past 10 years. , 5 shows that after excluding food and energy, the CPI in May was weaker than seasonally. Combined with the fact that the month-on-month fuel consumption for transportation in May was lower than the average of the same month in the past 10 years, while the month-on-month food CPI was significantly higher than the average of the past 10 years, it can be found that the core support for the month-on-month CPI to surpass the seasonality in May is the rapid recovery of food prices. The CPI in May recorded +0.3% year-on-year, which was the same as April and slightly lower than market expectations of +0.38%. The core CPI in May was +0.6% year-on-year, -0.1 PCTS compared with the previous month.

"In order to further improve the normalized dividend distribution mechanism of listed companies and improve the level of investor returns, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, based on regulatory practices, has issued the """"Regulatory Guidelines for Listed Companies No. 3 - Cash Dividends by Listed Companies"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines""""), and The """"Guidelines on the Articles of Association of Listed Companies"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Guidelines on the Articles of Association"""") have revised the relevant provisions on cash dividends and are now soliciting opinions from the public. Continuous and stable dividends help enhance investor returns, promote the establishment of a peaceful investment philosophy, and promote the stable and healthy development of the market. It also helps reduce the company\'s redundant funds, improve the efficiency of asset use, and guide the company to focus on its main business. Since the promulgation and implementation of the current """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""" and """"Articles of Association Guidelines"""", they have played an important role in improving the internal governance mechanism and external regulatory constraints on dividends, and the dividend situation of A-share listed companies has continued to improve. In the past five years, A-share listed companies have paid a cumulative dividend of 8.2 trillion yuan, and the annual dividend amount has begun to exceed the equity financing amount of the year. Among them, a total of 3,291 Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies paid cash dividends in 2022, with a dividend amount of 2.1 trillion yuan, of which 1.6 trillion yuan was distributed to domestic investors, a year-on-year increase of 22.7%, and the number of dividend payers accounted for 67.1%. The dividend payout rate (32.5%) and dividend rate (1.97%) are in the middle and upper reaches compared with major global capital markets. First, the scale of dividends has grown rapidly. The average annual growth rate of dividends over the past ten years has been 13.3%, which is higher than the growth rate of net profit in the same period (about 10%). Second, the habit of paying dividends has gradually developed. The proportion of companies paying dividends has increased from about 50% ten years ago to about 70%. The proportion of companies paying dividends for five consecutive years has increased from 20% to 48%. Third, the dividend characteristics are generally consistent with the development stage of the company, and the dividend levels of companies in different sectors and industries vary. However, compared with mature overseas markets, the balance, timeliness, and stability of dividends need to be further improved, and investors\' sense of gain needs to be enhanced. There are also some companies that pay abnormally high proportions of dividends, which may damage their solvency and ability to continue operating. It needs to be promptly Guide regulations The main idea of \u200b\u200bthis revision of cash dividend rules is to encourage companies to formulate clear dividend policies in their articles of association on the basis of adhering to corporate autonomy, and to stabilize investors\' dividend expectations. For companies that do not pay dividends and have large financial investments but low dividend ratios , urge dividends by strengthening disclosure requirements; facilitate the company\'s mid-term dividend implementation procedures, encourage companies to increase the frequency of cash dividends; strengthen the constraints on companies with abnormally high proportions of dividends, and guide reasonable dividends The revision of the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""" mainly includes three aspects: First, it further clarifies the orientation of encouraging cash dividends and promotes an increase in the level of dividends. Strengthen disclosure requirements and other institutional constraints on companies that do not pay dividends and urge them to pay dividends Pay special attention to companies with large financial investments but low dividend levels, urge them to increase their dividend levels, and focus on their main business The second is to simplify the mid-term dividend distribution process and promote further optimization of the dividend method and rhythm. Encourage companies to increase the frequency of dividends when conditions permit. In combination with regulatory practices, listed companies are allowed to review and approve the conditions and upper limits for mid-term cash dividends for the next year within a certain amount when convening annual shareholders\' meetings to review annual profit distribution plans, so as to facilitate companies to further Increase the frequency of dividends, allowing investors to better plan capital arrangements and share corporate growth dividends earlier The third is to strengthen the constraints on companies that pay abnormally high proportions of dividends and guide reasonable dividend distribution It is emphasized that when listed companies formulate cash dividend policies, they should comprehensively consider their own profitability, capital expenditure arrangements and debt repayment capabilities, as well as investor returns and company development. Pay close attention to companies with high asset-liability ratios, poor cash flows from operating activities, and large proportions of cash dividends to prevent adverse effects on the company\'s production, operations, and debt repayment capabilities. The relevant provisions of the """"Guidelines for the Articles of Association of Listed Companies"""" have been revised in three main aspects: First, listed companies are encouraged to increase the frequency of cash dividends under the conditions of profit distribution, guide the formation of mid-term dividend distribution habits, and stabilize investors\' dividend expectations Second, in accordance with the institutional arrangements for optimizing the implementation procedures for interim cash dividends in the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""", new requirements for the completion time limit for interim dividends have been added. The third is to urge companies to refine dividend policies in their articles of association, clarify the goals of cash dividends, and better stabilize investor expectations. At the same time, companies should be guided to formulate dividend restriction clauses in their articles of association to prevent companies from enlarging the risk of dividends when profits are unreal and debts are too high. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will simultaneously revise and improve the standardized operation guidelines for listed companies and clarify operational requirements. In the next step, the China Securities Regulatory Commission will further improve the """"Cash Dividend Guidelines"""" and """"Articles of Association Guidelines"""" based on the public solicitation of opinions, and issue and implement them as soon as possible",positive,positive,1,

"The consumer price index (CPI) is a relative number that measures the price level of consumer goods and services over time, reflecting the trend and degree of change in the price level of goods and services purchased by residents. Its annual rate of change is often used to reflect the extent of inflation or deflation; The CPI and its sub-indices are also an important reference for calculating GDP and the real value of assets, liabilities, consumption, and income. The compilation method of CPI is to select representative specifications among many measurement objects, collect their price data, calculate the average price and individual price index of these representative specifications, and then use the geometric average to calculate the basic classification price index, and then use the weighted average method to calculate the price index of small classes, medium classes and major categories step by step, until the total price index. According to the interpretation of the CPI indicator by the National Bureau of Statistics, the calculation process is as follows: First, the National Bureau of Statistics and local statistical offices determine the items of goods and services used to calculate the CPI, as well as the survey outlets. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has uniformly determined the categories of goods and services based on the sample survey data of urban and rural residents' household consumption expenditures across the country, and has set up 268 basic categories including food, tobacco and alcohol, clothing, housing, daily necessities and services, transportation and communications, education, culture and entertainment, medical care, and other supplies and services, which basically cover all the consumption content of urban and rural residents. About 500 cities and counties across the country were selected to determine the survey outlets for collecting prices, including grocery stores, department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, specialized markets, specialty stores, shopping centers, farmers' markets, and service consumption units, totaling 63,000. Secondly, in accordance with the method of """"""""assigning people, fixed points, and timing"""""""", the statistical department sends investigators to the survey outlets to collect prices on the spot. At present, there are about 4,000 price investigators in 500 survey cities and counties in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country. The frequency of price collection varies from commodity to commodity, and the price of grain, pork, beef and mutton, vegetables and other foods in the CPI that are closely related to residents' lives and have relatively frequent price changes are investigated every 5 days; For most industrial products such as clothing, shoes and hats, consumer durables, transportation and communication tools, the price is surveyed 2-3 times a month; For water, electricity and other government pricing items, the price is investigated and verified once a month. Finally, the price index of a single item of goods or services and 268 basic categories is calculated based on the original price information after review. Then, according to the corresponding weights of each category, the category price index and CPI are calculated. The weights in China's CPI are mainly determined according to the detailed proportion of the consumption expenditure of various goods and services of urban and rural households across the country. The CPI summary calculation method adopts a chain pull formula, which compiles month-on-month, month-on-month and fixed-base price indexes. The CPI is equal to 100, indicating that there is no change in the comprehensive price in the reporting period compared with the base period; If the consumer price index is greater than 100, it means that the comprehensive price has increased compared with the base period in the reporting period, and the higher the price index, the more the price has risen. If the consumer price index is less than 100, it indicates that the comprehensive price of goods decreased in the reporting period compared with the base period.",neutral,neutral,1,

However, the improvement in this data is mainly due to the significant improvement in durable goods consumption (especially automobiles), while non-durable goods consumption remains weak. In addition, goods The retail sales index continued to rebound in June, and the consumer confidence index in July rebounded slightly by 0.2 percentage points to 36.8 after rebounding in June.",positive,positive,1,
"More importantly, the key driving force for future consumption improvement - residents' income has improved significantly: the year-on-year growth rate of total cash income soared to 5.4% in June, but this was mainly due to the payment of bonus income. The year-on-year growth rate of core wages, which represents contract cash income, actually fell slightly by 0.1 percentage points to 2.7%, which has not yet fully reflected the results of the spring wage negotiations. Thanks to the improvement in total income, the year-on-year growth rate of actual wage income turned positive in June after being negative for 26 consecutive months, increasing by 1.1%.",positive,positive,1,
"On the other hand, enterprise-related economic indicators performed poorly in June. In terms of production, industrial production fell 3.6% month-on-month, the largest monthly decline since January this year. However, this was mainly affected by a new round of automobile quality inspections. Given that the impact of this round of quality inspections may be smaller than in the first quarter, industrial production may gradually recover thereafter. In terms of investment, both private machinery orders, which lead corporate investment, and private non-residential construction that has been started, which leads to investment in the construction industry, fell in June. Foreign trade performance was also not ideal. Although Japan's actual export index rebounded slightly by 7.2 to 168.8 in July, the actual import index soared to 180.7 (158.5 in June), causing the actual trade balance to turn into a deficit in July.",negative,negative,1,
"In terms of inflation, the July data has not yet reflected the positive impact of the sharp increase in wages in the spring. Although the core CPI excluding fresh food rose by 0.1 percentage points to 2.7% in July, this was mainly due to the rise in energy prices after the government abolished electricity and gas fees. The dual core CPI inflation rate excluding energy prices fell by another 0.3 percentage points to 1.9%. In addition to the continued decline in food CPI, the service industry CPI also fell by another 0.3 percentage points to 1.4%. Both declines were affected by last year's high base.",negative,neutral,0,negative
"Despite this, the hawkish Bank of Japan decided to raise interest rates in July beyond expectations and started to reduce its purchase of government bonds at the same time. At the interest rate meeting at the end of July, the Bank of Japan announced that the policy interest rate would be raised to 0.25% from the previous range of 0-0.1%. In explaining the reason for the rate hike, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda pointed out that Japan's economy and prices improved as expected, while the rise in import prices caused by the weakening of the yen increased the risk of inflation. Interestingly, at the same time as the decision to raise interest rates, the Bank of Japan's economic forecast lowered the core CPI year-on-year inflation forecast for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points to 2.5%, but raised the forecast for 2025 by 0.2 percentage points to 2.1%. The more critical dual core CPI inflation forecasts for 2024-2026 remain unchanged. In addition, the Bank of Japan lowered its economic growth forecast for this year by 0.2 percentage points to 0.6%, and maintained its outlook for 2025-2026 unchanged. The decision to unexpectedly raise interest rates without foreseeing better economic growth and inflation prospects reflects the hawkish stance of the current Bank of Japan.",positive,negative,0,positive
"At the same time, the reduction in government bond purchases, which had been announced in the June meeting, was officially launched after the July meeting. In August, the government bond purchase amount was reduced from the previous 5.7 trillion yen to 5.3 trillion yen, and then reduced by 400 billion yen each quarter until it reached 3 trillion yen per month in the first quarter of 2026. The reduction plan was slightly lower than the previous market expectations.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Based on the hawkish stance of the Bank of Japan, we believe that the Bank of Japan will still raise interest rates once later this year, and it may be implemented as early as the October meeting. Even though the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan Shinichi Uchida said in August that policymakers would not raise interest rates further if the financial market is unstable, we believe that this is just a verbal intervention by the central bank to appease investors and will not have much impact on its hawkish stance. Kazuo Ueda's testimony in the Diet on August 23 also showed that the central bank has not ruled out the possibility of further interest rate hikes this year.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The unexpected rate hike in July means that the Bank of Japan is more inclined to use their forward-looking thinking to make interest rate decisions relative to the current economic progress, and raising interest rates every three to four months may be in line with their operating thinking. However, if the quarterly short-term business survey released in early October and the private consumption data and inflation data in the following months are weaker than expected, we do not rule out that the Bank of Japan will delay the rate hike until December. It is worth noting that our interest rate forecast is based on the basic assumption that the US economy will enter a soft landing next. If the US non-farm payroll data deteriorates sharply again in August and the US economy is at risk of falling into recession, the Bank of Japan may be more cautious about its rate hike decision to prevent the Japanese economic growth rate from starting to decline under the circumstances of tighter monetary policy and weaker external demand. In the case of a US recession, the Bank of Japan may be more inclined to stay put this year.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Beware of the risk that the Bank of Japan is too hawkish and causes the Japanese economy to stagnate. We still believe that the Bank of Japan's rate hike at the end of July was a bit too hasty. Inflation data has not yet shown that the results of the March Spring War wage negotiations have been fully transmitted to wages and service CPI. Although private consumption has improved slightly, it has not improved significantly. It is still unknown whether the current recovery of the Japanese economy can withstand continued hawkish rate hikes. We believe that an early rate hike may affect the process of Japan's inflation rate returning to the target level of 2%. If the operation is too aggressive, it may even interrupt the hard-won path of normalization of the Japanese economy.",negative,negative,1,
"Under the basic assumption that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates once more this year, we expect the yen to still have room to appreciate. Since the Bank of Japan unexpectedly announced a rate hike at the end of July, the yen has appreciated by nearly 5% against the US dollar from 153.8 to 146.7 on August 20. Compared with the historical low of 161.6 in early July, it has appreciated by more than 10%. Looking ahead, the Fed's September rate cut is almost certain. The only question may be whether it will be a 25 basis point cut or a 50 basis point cut due to concerns about the labor market. Under the basic assumption that the US economy can achieve a soft landing, we expect the hawkish Bank of Japan to raise interest rates by another 25 basis points as early as October. The interest rate gap between the two countries may narrow further. Therefore, we predict that the yen may gradually rise against the US dollar in fluctuations, and the end-of-year point will be between 140-145.",positive,neutral,0,positive

And why do we remain so optimistic about the U.S. economy?",positive,positive,1,

"1. We believe that this economic cycle is different from the past. Market participants are often accustomed to inductive approaches, such as the Great Depression, the 1970s, and so on.

"2. We must have determination, believe in common sense, and not be fooled by short-term phenomena. Much of the noise in the market is caused by liquidity, market structure, the emotions of market participants, and even market manipulation. The power of hedge funds and quantitative funds in the U.S. stock market is very powerful and can create a lot of noise and panic in the short term, causing some timid investors to panic and cut their stocks out in order to achieve the purpose of short selling profits. In the past year, we can see the shadow of hedge fund manipulation in the stock prices of Apple, Tesla, and Netflix.",neutral,neutral,1,
"3. In the past two years, our economists have ignored the durability of the superimposed effects of the U.S. government’s fiscal deficit and the Federal Reserve’s QE dual stimulus during this epidemic. Each has a scale of trillions of dollars, and the superimposed effect reaches 1+1>2. The impact on the real economy and the market has been turbulent and resolved very slowly. It shows that the resilience of employment and the economy is longer and stronger than expected.",neutral,positive,0,negative
"4. The evolution of the business cycle is often not linear, so it cannot be simply linearly extrapolated. At this point in time, the Republican Party, which has long neglected its duties, has begun to resume its normal budget watchdog function under the leadership of the new speaker, and closes the large-scale water pipes of the Democratic Party, and the fiscal stimulus will be at the end of the war. Therefore, coupled with the high degree of tightening of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, it may cause the U.S. economy to slow down or even turn into autumn overnight. This slowdown may be a sudden slowdown, and the disease may come like a mountain.",negative,negative,1,
"The Treasury is a big player in influencing interest rates. Yellen was criticized by Drukenmiller, a partner of Soros, who believed that she was incompetent and did not issue more debt when long-term interest rates were low. As a result, she was forced to issue debt when interest rates are now high, resulting in increased interest expenses. This criticism is reasonable because Yellen is an economist whose style is more academic than practical. In fact, the Biden administration does not take Yellen's opinions and views seriously, and treats her more like a flower vase. Yellen probably did not expect that the Biden administration would continue to borrow without a bottom line.",negative,negative,1,
"However, the criticism is obviously effective. The Ministry of Finance announced the financing plan for the fourth quarter. The overall scale was lower than expected, with a reduction of US$76 billion. The balance of the Treasury Department's account is also very high, exceeding the pre-epidemic level, about more than 750 billion U.S. dollars, reducing the need for subsequent bond issuance. The direct consequence of this news is that long-term bond interest rates in the United States continue to fall, because there are many shorts to cover. The Ministry of Finance also plans to restart the debt buyback plan in 2024 to improve the debt structure and borrow more low-interest debt to repay high interest rates.",positive,positive,1,
"The Federal Reserve also had an important event last Wednesday. The result of the November interest rate meeting was to suspend interest rate hikes. Powell also did not discuss the possibility of raising interest rates one more time, suggesting that there will be no rate hike in December. After all, long-term bond interest rates have soared and financial conditions have tightened, which is equivalent to raising interest rates twice. The futures market expects that the probability of an interest rate hike in December is around 10%, and interest rate cuts will probably begin in May or June next year, with a 100 basis point rate cut throughout the year. But we should also note that the expectations of the futures market may be too optimistic.",neutral,neutral,1,

The growth rates for the same period from 2021 to 2023 are 3.6% (compounded over two years), -4.8%, and 3.3% (compounded over two years) respectively. After deducting the impact of special factors such as the tax deferment of small, medium and micro enterprises in the same period last year, which raised the base, and some tax reduction policies introduced in the middle of last year, the comparable growth rate was about 2.0%.

The growth rates are all higher than those in March. Somewhat downward. The decline in the growth rate of the four major tax categories may be related to the still low nominal economic growth rate; the decline in the growth rate of domestic consumption tax is mutually confirmed by the low growth rate of commodity retail sales in April, reflecting that the current domestic consumption still needs to be boosted; compared with corporate income tax The decline in the same period last year and in March was partly due to the impact of the tax deferred payment of small, medium and micro enterprises in the same period last year, which raised the base. On the other hand, it was also related to the continued low ex-factory price of industrial products. In April, the decline in personal income tax was wider, and the cumulative year-on-year growth rate It has been negative since February last year. 2) Taxes related to import and export performed well. The cumulative year-on-year growth rate of import value-added tax turned positive for the first time since 2023, reflecting the rise in my country’s import demand; the decline in the scale of export tax rebates for foreign trade companies narrowed, reflecting the gradual entry of overseas manufacturing.

The total expenditure on the four items of infrastructure construction has turned from negative to positive since September last year, and the cumulative year-on-year growth rate from January to April this year has risen to 7.9%. This may be because the issuance of special bonds has accelerated since August last year, and the issuance of government bonds has accelerated since September. The additional issuance of 1 trillion treasury bonds will be used to support post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and improve disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities, and will be directly invested in infrastructure fields such as water conservancy, and most of the additional treasury bonds issuance has already begun.",neutral,neutral,1,

The general public budget and government fund budget revenue are both negative, mainly related to the decrease in government land sales revenue (-10.4 %); the cumulative growth rate of broad fiscal expenditures from January to April was -2.3%, a wider decline than the previous month, mainly due to the slow pace of special bond issuance since the beginning of the year. The issuance of new special bonds has been slow this year, with only 44% of actual issuances/planned issuances in April. The cumulative progress of new special bonds in the first four months was 18.5%, which is far lower than the 2019-2023 average (30%), which may reflect the small reserve of infrastructure projects in various regions and the slow start of construction.",negative,negative,1,

For capacity building, 1 trillion yuan will be issued first this year. The Politburo meeting on April 30 stated that it is necessary to issue and make good use of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds as soon as possible, speed up the issuance and use of special bonds, and maintain necessary fiscal expenditure intensity. However, judging from the special treasury bond issuance plan announced by the Ministry of Finance on May 13, the issuance of 1 trillion ultra-long special treasury bonds is relatively scattered from May to November, and the number of issuances from June to October is relatively large.

"This round of RMB appreciation at the end of 2023 has a different flavor. How big will this round of exchange rate appreciation be? Why did the appreciation of the exchange rate not bring about a rise in the stock market? Let’s start with these two issues to analyze the new changes in exchange rates in recent years, and look forward to 2024 based on these changes. For the first question, our answer may be different from what seems intuitive - the RMB\'s increase may be too large, and this is also the answer to the second question.",neutral,neutral,1,
"To understand the logic behind it, we believe that the core reason is the stronger policy attribute of the exchange rate this year.

From mid-September to mid-November this year, the People\'s Bank of China fixed the central parity rate at around 7.18, helping the RMB exchange rate to hold the bottom line of 7.32. During this period, the U.S. dollar once rose above 107, setting a new high for the year. , and this exchange rate adjustment method has rarely appeared after the exchange reform in August 2015.",neutral,negative,0,negative
"If policy intervention is not considered, the low point of the RMB exchange rate this year was around 7.41 and around 7.39 in early November. The RMB appreciation rate in November has reached 3.5%.

This appreciation is considerable.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"We believe that the important reason behind this is the competition between China and the United States, which has led to the exchange rate needing both a U.S. dollar anchor and a """"policy bottom."""" In our previous analysis framework, the U.S. dollar has always been an important benchmark for the RMB exchange rate.

From the first three quarters, China’s US dollar-denominated GDP growth rate was about -2%, with the exchange rate depreciating. The range exceeds 6%.

Calculated by a low standard, the average depreciation rate of the US dollar against the RMB in 2024 should not be higher than the nominal GDP growth rate. We predict that China\'s nominal GDP growth rate in 2024 may be 5.2%, and the corresponding depreciation bottom line of the RMB exchange rate is 7.45. According to high standards, the IMF predicts that the US nominal GDP growth rate in 2024 will be about 3.8%, which corresponds to China\'s economic growth rate of 5.9%. This requires an additional 0.7% appreciation of the RMB in 2024, and the corresponding bottom line of the RMB exchange rate is 7.03. Therefore, from this perspective, the policy may hope that the RMB will appreciate significantly.",neutral,neutral,1,
"It is worth noting that an important logic behind this is that the better the U.S. economy is and the weaker our country\'s economy is, the greater the need to stabilize the exchange rate, especially as the efficiency of domestic economic stabilization policies has declined in recent years. This will not only prevent the exchange rate from functioning as an """"automatic stabilizer"""" for the economy, but will also limit the space for countercyclical adjustment of monetary policy, especially interest rate policy (we will explain the impact on monetary policy in more detail in subsequent reports).",negative,negative,1,
"Another consequence of the """"policy bottom"""" is that the """"procyclical"""" market signal of the RMB exchange rate has become less meaningful.",negative,neutral,0,negative
"In terms of the exchange rate itself, the biggest impact of policy intervention is the sharp decline in transaction volume. After sticking to the bottom line of 7.32 in mid-September, the USD/CNY transaction volume in September, October and November all fell to the lowest in the same period since data is available. Therefore, with the U.S. dollar peaking and falling and the accumulation of funds to be settled approaching the end of the year, the RMB will appreciate rapidly in the short term. We also expect that the RMB exchange rate will show a """"more rapid"""" trend in the next one or two months. Easily appreciate in value.”",negative,neutral,0,positive
"And precisely because there are more market microstructure and seasonal factors behind this """"significant"""" appreciation of the exchange rate, its instructive effect on the stock market has also weakened.

This time it\'s different.",negative,neutral,0,negative

“Financing currency”: an important constraint on monetary policy,negative,neutral,0,negative
"When the former is combined with the """"new normal"""" of inverted interest rate differentials between China and the United States, it will lead to the rise of the """"financing currency"""" attribute of the RMB and the rise of carry trade. Simply put, investors tend to sell low-cost, low-volatility assets while buying high-yielding assets, thereby obtaining more stable positive returns. A typical example is the Japanese yen. International investors were once keen to borrow Japanese yen to purchase other relatively high-interest assets, such as U.S. debt.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The rise of this carry trade also means the continuous accumulation of """"natural"""" short positions. The disadvantage is that currencies are very sensitive to interest rates and liquidity environments at home and abroad. If we pay attention to the exchange rate, domestic monetary policy, especially interest rate cuts, will be greatly constrained.",negative,negative,1,
"This year, the characteristics of RMB as a financing currency have become increasingly obvious. We usually use the """"interest spread/volatility"""" indicator to measure whether a currency is suitable as a financing currency in carry transactions - generally the larger the interest rate spread relative to other currencies and the smaller the volatility, the better. , the greater the negative value of this indicator, the more prominent the characteristics of RMB as a financing currency.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Two major changes in monetary policy this year are related to this. The first is to be more """"stingy"""" with interest rate cuts. In the third quarter of this year, when the economy is under the greatest pressure, it only cut interest rates by 15bp (MLF interest rate), causing the actual interest rate to rise this year. The second is to be more vigilant about """"idling of funds"""", and the risk of idling of funds and interest rate fluctuations. The decline (we use the difference between DR007 and the reverse repurchase rate to measure) will amplify the depreciation pressure of the RMB. After August this year, the central bank and other regulatory agencies have significantly strengthened the governance of this phenomenon. This is reflected in the fact that although liquidity has not been reduced, However, the currency market continues to be tight. We expect these conditions to continue in 2024, but will ease to some extent when external pressure decreases.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The economy """"feeds back"""" the exchange rate: the dilemma between exports and inflation",neutral,neutral,1,
"With both the exchange rate and interest rates being constrained, in order to stabilize growth, a third important change has occurred: the economy """"feeds back"""" the exchange rate, exacerbating the weakness of internal inflation. China\'s exports in 2023 are not bad compared to the world. As of July this year, the export share has only dropped by 0.3 percentage points compared with the end of last year. It has made an important contribution to stabilizing growth amid weak domestic demand. In addition to the structural adjustment of exports, China\'s real effective exchange rate has dropped to a low in the past 10 years.",negative,neutral,0,neutral
"However, the real reason for the decline in the real exchange rate comes from the decline in domestic prices, rather than the decline in the nominal exchange rate. On the contrary, the latter is at a higher level due to policy reasons. It is precisely because of this year\'s decline in wage levels and corporate profit margins that China\'s exports have remained competitive, but this has also led to weak domestic inflation and insufficient demand.",negative,neutral,0,negative
"In 2024, we will also face the same problem: the trade-off between exchange rate appreciation and downward domestic inflation. In the context of weak domestic demand, external demand and exports are important sources of economic resilience. To maintain exports, if the RMB exchange rate rebounds sharply, domestic prices will need to fall to keep the real exchange rate at a low level; if exports are not maintained, exchange rate appreciation and the loss of economic momentum will eventually drag down domestic demand and inflation.",negative,neutral,0,negative
"Based on the above analysis, we believe that the biggest difficulty in predicting the RMB exchange rate in 2024 is that policy demands may be greater than before. This can certainly ensure that the RMB exchange rate has a """"bottom"""", but what may be more noteworthy is that in the case of changes in the market structure, the RMB exchange rate cannot be allowed to appreciate too quickly.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Looking forward to 2024, we have three main basic judgments on the RMB: 1) It will appreciate moderately throughout the year; 2) According to the normal pace, depreciation pressure will be greater in the first half of the year, but this may not be in line with policy demands; 2) The overall pace On the index, it shows the characteristics of """"high at the beginning and end of the year, low in the middle"""", and may rise above 7 in stages.",neutral,neutral,1,
"From a market perspective, the central decline of the US dollar determines the basic direction of the RMB. In 2024, we expect that the center of the U.S. dollar index will decline compared with 2023, but there will not be a trend of depreciation. After the epidemic, especially since 2022, the economic pattern of """"the United States is relatively strong, Europe and China are relatively weak"""" and the tight global liquidity situation will not fundamentally change in 2024: both the Chinese and European economies are facing transformation. In the context of geopolitical tensions and balance sheet reduction, the problem of tight global liquidity will not fundamentally change, but the extent will be improved compared to 2023.",neutral,neutral,1,
"A rate cut by the Fed has never been a sufficient condition for a sharp depreciation of the dollar. Exchange rates have always been a relative concept. When looking forward to the Fed\'s interest rate cuts, don\'t forget that from a fundamental perspective, China and Europe may have greater urgency to cut interest rates and ease in 2024. A typical example is 2019. Against the background of the global economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in the second half of 2019, and the US dollar continued to appreciate throughout the year.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Therefore, under our base case, we do not expect the U.S. dollar center to fall below 100 in 2024. On the contrary, the market\'s expectations for the upward risk of the U.S. dollar are insufficient.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The pace of interest rate cuts in China and the United States will become an important factor affecting the periodic appreciation and depreciation of the RMB. Precisely because the RMB\'s """"financing currency"""" attribute has increased, in addition to the US dollar index, it will also be more sensitive to changes in Sino-US interest rates.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The pace of interest rate cuts that is more comfortable for the exchange rate in 2024 may be to follow the Fed\'s operations. In the first half of the year, we mainly completed the tasks of supporting the economy and stabilizing the exchange rate through the operations of """"MLF and reserve requirement ratio reduction + tightening of money market liquidity + raising offshore market financing interest rates""""; in the second half of the year, we followed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which basically ensures that the RMB will continue to adjust accordingly.

"Under this circumstance, the basic rhythm of the RMB exchange rate will be: partial appreciation in the first quarter, weakening in the second quarter due to repeated expectations of Fed interest rate cuts and seasonal factors, and depreciation of the RMB in the third quarter after the Fed\'s interest rate cuts are implemented and the People\'s Bank of China follows suit. The price fluctuated and appreciated, and then appreciated again in the fourth quarter due to policy tasks and seasonal factors.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The biggest uncertainty lies in how strong the demand for """"policy bottom"""" is. If we evaluate the results of Sino-US economic competition based on half a year, then the RMB exchange rate will need to rise significantly above 7 in the first half of the year. This may seriously interfere with the rhythm of the whole year: due to the sharp appreciation of the exchange rate in the first half of the year, the momentum of economic recovery may be significantly weakened, leading to a loss of market confidence and an increase in the need for more easing in the second half of the year.

As U.S. bond interest rates rise, the price-performance ratio of stocks and bonds is bound to decline; rising economic and policy uncertainty may curb stock market risk appetite. Second, the U.S. dollar index may remain relatively strong. The 10-year U.S. and German bond interest rate spread has exceeded the high in November 2022 (when the U.S. dollar index rose above 110). The recent rise in geopolitical risks and increased upward pressure on oil prices have weakened the economic growth prospects of Europe, Japan and other non-U.S. economies, further increasing the dollar index. Third, there may be a risk of a periodic correction in gold prices. If geopolitical conflicts do not expand beyond expectations, the price of gold may be more affected by the actual interest rate on U.S. debt and the U.S. dollar exchange rate.",positive,neutral,0,neutral

"However, fiscal efforts will help accelerate economic growth in the second half of the year. In July, new social financing was 770.8 billion yuan, an increase of 234.2 billion yuan year-on-year, mainly supported by government bond financing, while new RMB loans were relatively low. On the one hand, it reflects that the """"water squeeze"""" effect of financial data continues. Although it has caused a decline in total indicators, it has helped to improve quality and efficiency to a certain extent; on the other hand, it reflects that the current structure still needs to be optimized, especially the medium and long-term loans of enterprises have a large drag in this period, and the bill rush is obvious, reflecting that enterprises are not willing to invest actively.",neutral,positive,0,neutral

Under the influence of a series of real estate policies, residents\' willingness to buy houses may improve marginally. However, judging from the transaction area of \u200b\u200blarge and medium-sized commercial housing on July 30, the pressure on the real estate side is still severe, and the overall housing purchase expectations of residents have not entered a clear recovery channel.

In the past three months, government bond financing has remained at a high level, and the issuance of special bonds has also accelerated, which has significantly boosted social financing, reflecting that in the current context of insufficient overall economic growth momentum and relatively low credit demand, the fiscal side has accelerated financing to support broad fiscal expenditures to drive economic growth.

Under the dual influence of the low overall investment willingness of enterprises and the suspension of """"manual interest payments"""", the degree of activation of corporate funds is low, and corporate demand deposits continue to flow to money funds and wealth management products, which restricts the growth rate of M1.

If school students are included in age groups, young people looking for part-time jobs in school and young people looking for jobs after graduation will not be accurately reflected. The employment and unemployment situation of young people who enter society and really need work. Calculating the unemployment rate by age group that does not include school students will help more accurately reflect the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society, provide them with more precise employment services, and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies.",positive,neutral,0,neutral
"On the other hand, it is to more completely reflect the employment and unemployment situation of young people from school graduation to stable work. The number of years of education received by young people in our country continues to increase. At present, the gross enrollment rate of higher education in our country is nearly 60%. Most young people have just graduated when they are 24 years old and are still in the career selection period. Some are not employed or have unstable employment. By the age of 29, the vast majority The job selection period has passed and the employment situation has become stable. All sectors of society are very concerned about the employment situation of young people when they first leave school, and are also very concerned about their employment situation within a period of time after graduation. Therefore, our bureau has increased its estimates and released the unemployment rate for the labor force aged 25-29.",positive,neutral,0,neutral
"Regarding the release method, in the future, our bureau will release the unemployment rate of the labor force aged 16-24, 25-29, and 30-59 years old excluding school students in the data release database of the National Bureau of Statistics on a monthly basis.

"I will introduce it here first, and then answer your questions.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you, Director Kang, for your introduction. Now we enter the question and answer session. Please inform your news organization before asking questions.",neutral,neutral,1,
Beijing Youth Daily reporter:,neutral,neutral,1,
"I would like to ask about the overall situation. In 2023, faced with multiple challenges such as sluggish world economic recovery, frequent domestic natural disasters, and arduous tasks of reform, development and stability, what is the overall performance of China\'s economic operation? Judging from last year, have our main goals and tasks been achieved relatively well throughout the year? Thanks.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. In the previous introduction, I gave a relatively detailed introduction to the performance of the entire Chinese economy throughout the year. Overall, our main expected goals have been successfully achieved. It can be said that a report card of good quality and sufficient weight has been handed over. As for the economic performance in the past year, it can be summarized as a recovery that is improving, full of quality, brilliant performance, and extremely difficult.",positive,positive,1,
"First, the rebound is improving. In terms of economic growth, china\'s GDP exceeded 126 trillion yuan last year, and the growth rate was 2.2 percentage points faster than in 2022. Looking at the quarters, it shows a trend of low in the first, high in the middle, and stable in the end, and the good trend is further consolidated. Calculated at comparable prices, the economic increment in 2023 will exceed 6 trillion yuan, which is equivalent to the annual economic aggregate of a medium-sized country. Per capita GDP has steadily increased, reaching 89,358 yuan in 2023, an increase of 5.4% over the previous year. From the perspective of employment, the employment situation has improved overall. The annual surveyed urban unemployment rate dropped by 0.4 percentage points compared with the previous year. In particular, the employment situation of migrant workers has improved significantly. In terms of prices, prices generally maintained a moderate increase. The annual CPI increased by 0.2%, and the core CPI increased by 0.7%. From the perspective of the balance of payments, exports of goods increased by 0.6% throughout the year, and foreign exchange reserves exceeded US$3.2 trillion at the end of the year.",positive,positive,1,
"Second, it is of high quality. Last year, we coordinated the effective improvement of quality and reasonable growth of quantity. The whole country focused on the primary task of high-quality development to promote the economy to continuously gain advantages in structural adjustment, transformation and upgrading, and to achieve more high-quality development. The innovation-driven development strategy has been implemented in depth, and investment in innovation has steadily increased. Preliminary calculations show that the total investment in research and experimental development in 2023 will reach 3.32782 billion yuan, and the intensity of R&D investment will reach 2.64%, an increase of 0.08 percentage points from the previous year. During the year, there were frequent good news about some major scientific and technological innovations, especially the solid advancement of high-end, intelligent, and green development of the manufacturing industry. The economic structure has been optimized and upgraded, and the service industry and consumption have become more prominent as the main engines of economic growth. In 2023, the added value of the service industry will account for 54.6% of GDP, an increase of 1.2 percentage points from the previous year; the contribution rate of final consumer spending to economic growth will reach 82.5%, an increase of 43.1 percentage points from the previous year. The foundation for safe development was further consolidated. Annual grain output increased by 1.3% over the previous year, raw coal increased by 2.9%, crude oil increased by 2%, and natural gas increased by 5.8%. The bottom line of no systemic risks has been maintained, financial and economic security has been ensured, people\'s livelihood protection has been more effective, and the national per capita disposable income has actually increased by 6.1% over the previous year.",positive,positive,1,
"Third, the performance is brilliant. When observing the performance of China\'s economy, we must not only compare it vertically with ourselves, but also compare it horizontally with other countries. china\'s economic growth rate of 5.2% in 2023 is not only higher than the global expected growth rate of about 3%, but also ranks among the best among the world\'s major economies. china\'s economy is expected to contribute more than 30% to world economic growth in 2023, making it the largest engine of world economic growth. At the same time, despite the expected decline in global trade, china\'s exports have also achieved slight growth, and their share of the global market has remained stable. Another point is that the overall price increase is moderate, which is in sharp contrast to the high global inflation and the difficult balance between anti-inflation and stabilizing growth in some countries.",positive,positive,1,
"Fourth, it is extremely difficult. You don’t know how difficult things are until they have happened. In 2023, the world economy will be in a downturn, the international landscape will be complexly evolving, geopolitical conflicts will occur frequently, and the external environment will become more complex, severe, and uncertain. There are many cyclical and structural contradictions in the country, and natural disasters occur frequently. Under such complex circumstances, achieving such development results is even more commendable. These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the result of the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and the result of the people across the country working hard and forging ahead. The achievements deserve full recognition. , need to be cherished more.",positive,positive,1,
"Looking forward to 2024, we must also see that the current external environment is still complex and severe. There is insufficient domestic effective demand, overcapacity in some industries, weak social expectations, and there are still many risks and hazards. To promote the further recovery of our country\'s economy, we still need to overcome some problems. difficulties and challenges. We must follow the decisions and arrangements of the Central Economic Work Conference, effectively respond to these difficulties, solve these problems, and continue to promote the stability and long-term development of China\'s economy.

Global Times reporter:,neutral,neutral,1,
I would like to ask the publisher to introduce the contribution rate and pulling point of the three major demands to economic growth in the fourth quarter and the whole year of 2023? Are there any new changes? I would also like to know how the domestic and international dual circulation pattern has developed over the past year. Thanks.,neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. You are concerned about two issues, one is the three major demand situations, and the other is the double cycle situation. First of all, to answer your first question, the contribution and pull of the three major needs. In 2023, final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, and net exports of goods and services will drive economic growth by 4.3, 1.5, and -0.6 percentage points respectively, and their contribution rates to economic growth will be 82.5%, 28.9%, and -11.4% respectively. In the fourth quarter, final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation, and net exports of goods and services drove economic growth by 4.2, 1.2, and -0.2 percentage points respectively, and contributed 80%, 23.1%, and -3.1% to economic growth respectively.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The second question is the progress of domestic and international dual circulation. It should be said that new progress has been made in building a new development pattern in 2023, which has three characteristics:",neutral,positive,0,neutral
"First, the main role of the domestic circulation is increasing. Based on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand and releasing the potential of the strong domestic demand market, the role of domestic circulation in driving economic development has been significantly enhanced. In 2023, china\'s total retail sales of consumer goods will reach 47.1 trillion yuan, and the scale of fixed asset investment will be 50.3 trillion yuan. The contribution rate of domestic demand to economic growth will reach 111.4%, an increase of 25.3 percentage points from the previous year. We are working hard to build a unified national market, open up the blockages in the domestic circulation, and smooth all links of production, distribution, circulation and consumption. The flow of factors has also become more active, and the connection between production and marketing is gradually improving. In the fourth quarter, the industrial capacity utilization rate above designated size was 75.9%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points year-on-year; the product sales rate of industrial enterprises above designated size remained stable at a level of above 97%. The annual operating freight volume increased by 8.2%, and the operating passenger volume increased by 66.5% year-on-year.",positive,positive,1,
"Second, the quality and level of international circulation have been further improved. Faced with adverse impacts such as shrinking external demand, china has stepped up its efforts to stabilize the scale and optimize the structure of foreign trade, and exports have achieved positive growth. The horizontal ratio is better than that of major export-oriented economies, and the share of the international market remains generally stable. In 2023, the export volume of goods will increase by 0.6% over the previous year, and the proportion of imports and exports of general trade and private enterprises will increase. At the same time, china is also actively expanding international economic and trade cooperation and jointly building the """"Belt and Road"""" with high quality. It has become a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, and the international circulation is wider and deeper. In 2023, china\'s total import and export volume to countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative increased by 2.8% compared with the previous year.",positive,positive,1,
"Third, domestic and international circulation reinforce each other. The advantages of our ultra-large-scale market have emerged, and the expansion of domestic demand has boosted imports. In 2023, the import value of agricultural products increased by 5% over the previous year, consumer goods increased by 1.2%, and energy product imports increased by 27.2%. The advantages of a sound industrial system and stable production capacity have also been brought into play. The stabilization and quality improvement of exports have brought about the development of related domestic industries and provided assistance to the overall improvement of the economy. In 2023, china\'s exports of goods will hit a new record high. Among them, exports of mechanical and electrical products increased by 2.9% over the previous year. The export volume of the """"three new"""" products represented by electric passenger vehicles, solar cells, and lithium-ion batteries also exceeded the one trillion yuan mark for the first time, with an increase of 29.9%.",positive,positive,1,
"While we see positive progress in the domestic and international dual circulation, we must also see that there are still some bottlenecks in the domestic circulation. The world economy continues to be sluggish, the global industrial and supply chains are undergoing profound adjustments, and the international circulation is also facing some difficulties and challenges. In the next step, we need to coordinate the expansion of domestic demand and deepen supply-side structural reform, coordinate high-quality development and high-level security, coordinate the advancement of deep-seated reform and high-level opening up, break through the key blocking points that restrict the economic cycle, and promote the mutual promotion of domestic and international dual cycles. .

Recent data shows that China’s CPI recorded negative growth for the third consecutive month in December. What is the outlook for CPI? Will the government take measures to combat low prices?,neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. The price issue is of great concern to all sectors of society. Judging from the overall situation in 2023, china\'s prices generally maintain a moderate upward trend, with the CPI rising by 0.2% throughout the year. As this reporter mentioned, CPI has been experiencing negative growth for three consecutive months. How to look at this issue? We look at the overall data, but also at the structural data. The year-on-year decline in CPI in the past few months is mainly structural and phased.",positive,neutral,0,neutral
"First, let’s talk about structure first. The main factor in recent price declines is a fall in food and energy prices. If the impact of food and energy prices is excluded, the core CPI remains stable, which shows that this price decline is not universal and comprehensive, but local and structural. The decline in food and energy prices is not entirely a change in market supply and demand. Judging from the two years of 2022 and 2023, it is mainly affected by some non-economic and unconventional factors. Let\'s talk about energy first. Now energy prices, especially oil prices, have a larger weight in our country\'s CPI basket. Energy prices fell by 0.5% in December 2023, while they rose by 5.2% in the same period last year. As we all know, energy prices are mainly affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. Energy prices will rise sharply in 2022 and then fall back in 2023. One is positive and the other is negative, and the year-on-year downward pull is relatively large. Looking at food again, the price in December 2023 dropped by 3.7% year-on-year. In the same period last year, that is, in December 2022, it increased by 4.8%. Mainly affected by the epidemic in December 2022, logistics was not smooth, and the prices of various foods were rising. After normal operation was restored, supply was sufficient, and food prices naturally fell based on the high base of the previous year.",positive,neutral,0,neutral
"Second, the decline in CPI is phased. In particular, china\'s economy is picking up and improving, residents\' income is growing steadily, domestic aggregate demand will also expand, and there are foundations and conditions for the rebound in prices of goods and services. As the Spring Festival holiday approaches recently, food consumption demand is also increasing. People are more active in consuming services such as dining out, visiting relatives and friends, and traveling. These will contribute to the seasonal recovery of CPI. Judging from the month-on-month situation, the CPI increased by 0.1% month-on-month in December 2023. In early January 2024, judging from the monitoring situation, some food prices remained stable and slightly increased. In addition, in addition to supply and demand, prices are also affected by expectations. Judging from the recent situation, the expected confidence of both enterprises and residents has recovered marginally. In December, the expected index of manufacturing production and operating activities reached 55.9%, and the expected index of non-manufacturing business activities reached 60.3%, both at a high level. boom range. In the fourth quarter, the prosperity index of enterprises above designated size was 109 points, 0.4 points higher than the previous quarter. The consumer confidence index in December rose by 0.6 points from the previous month.",positive,positive,1,
"Third, low prices also reflect problems such as insufficient effective demand to a certain extent. Insufficient effective demand is a phased phenomenon as the economy gradually returns to normal after our country has experienced three years of impact from the epidemic. Insufficient demand in the short term will lead to price declines. The central government attaches great importance to the problem of insufficient demand. When planning the economic work for 2024, the Central Economic Work Conference clearly emphasized that efforts should be made to expand domestic demand and promote consumption from post-epidemic recovery to sustained expansion, and clearly pointed out a series of specific work directions. With the introduction and implementation of these policies at the Central Economic Work Conference, the problem of insufficient effective demand will be gradually alleviated, and consumer prices are expected to stabilize and rise. We expect modest price increases in 2024. Thanks.",positive,neutral,0,positive

High-quality development is the primary task of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way. How is china\'s current progress in high-quality economic development? What measures will be taken in the future to continue to promote high-quality economic development? Thanks.,neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. High-quality development is the last word in the new era and the primary task of comprehensively building a modern socialist country. In 2023, all regions and departments have made great efforts to stabilize economic operations, and they have not relaxed their efforts in promoting high-quality development. Our country\'s economy has achieved effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth, and the road to high-quality development is on track. More determined, more powerful. To sum up, it can be summarized in five """"further steps"""".",positive,positive,1,
"First, important progress has been made in the construction of a modern industrial system, and the transformation of development momentum has been further accelerated. The modern industrial system is an important foundation for high-quality development. All regions and departments insist on scientific and technological innovation to lead the construction of a modern industrial system, and solidly promote the high-end, intelligent, and green transformation of the manufacturing industry. The new drivers and new advantages of china\'s economic development continue to grow, and modernization New progress has been made in the construction of industrial systems.",positive,positive,1,
"Second, reform and opening up have been advanced in depth, and development vitality has been further released. In 2023, our country will make every effort to promote the construction of a unified national market, optimize the development environment of the private economy, continue to create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, rule-by-law, and international, and effectively enhance the power and vitality of economic development. As of the end of September 2023, the number of registered business entities nationwide has reached 181 million, of which 122 million are individual industrial and commercial households. Accelerating the promotion of high-level opening up to the outside world, actively carrying out international economic and trade exchanges and cooperation, jointly building the """"Belt and Road"""" with high quality, successfully holding the China International Import Expo, the Fair for Trade in Services and the Canton Fair, china\'s import and export volume to countries co-building the """"Belt and Road"""" increased by 2.8% %. The annual intended transaction volume of the CIIE increased by 6.7% compared with the previous session.",positive,positive,1,
"Third, green and low-carbon transformation continues to deepen, and the development model further changes. Our country insists on promoting economic development in the green and low-carbon transformation, and the green production methods and lifestyles are accelerating the formation. Actively build a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system, and the energy consumption structure continues to be optimized. Preliminary calculations show that the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption in total energy consumption in 2023 will increase by 0.2 percentage points from the previous year. By the end of 2023, china\'s renewable energy power generation installed capacity will account for more than half of the total installed capacity, historically surpassing thermal power. The output of green and low-carbon products is also growing rapidly. In 2023, new energy vehicles will increase by 30.3% over the previous year, with production and sales ranking first in the world; exports of electric passenger vehicles will increase by 67.1%.",positive,positive,1,
"Fourth, people’s livelihood protection is strong and effective, and people’s lives have been further improved. Improving people\'s livelihood and well-being is the fundamental purpose of development. In 2023, the income of urban and rural residents will grow steadily, the level of public services and social security will continue to improve, and areas of shortcomings in people\'s livelihood will also gradually strengthen, further polishing the people\'s livelihood foundation for high-quality development. The per capita disposable income of residents increased by 6.1%, of which transfer payments such as social relief and subsidies from the government, policy living subsidies, and cash policy subsidies for farmers increased by 10.3%. Investment in people\'s livelihood continues to increase. Investment in the production and supply of electricity, heat, gas and water increased by 23%, and agricultural investment increased by 9.3%, both significantly faster than all investment.",positive,positive,1,
"Fifth, the ability to ensure food and energy security has been improved, and the foundation for safe development has been further consolidated. In 2023, our country has better ensured security in its development and achieved good development on the basis of security.",positive,positive,1,
"Of course, we must also realize that our country is still in a critical period of transforming its development model, optimizing its economic structure, and transforming its growth momentum. Many difficulties and challenges still need to be overcome to further promote high-quality development. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference, regard high-quality development as the last word in the new era, coordinate high-quality development and high-level security, continuously achieve effective improvement in economic quality and reasonable growth in quantity, and realize the grandiose goal of Chinese-style modernization. The blueprint becomes a beautiful reality step by step. Thanks.",neutral,neutral,1,
"I am also more concerned about structural issues. I would like to ask, how can we achieve the conversion of new and old driving forces in China\'s economic development? The report also shows that new energy vehicles and solar cells are growing rapidly. However, in the process of vigorously developing advanced manufacturing, how can we prevent possible overcapacity problems? In addition, with relatively insufficient domestic demand, will the rapid expansion of these industries bring downward pressure on prices and possible international trade frictions?

Spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics Wang Guanhua:,neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. Regarding the questions you mentioned, I would like to answer them mainly from two aspects:",neutral,neutral,1,
"First of all, the first point is about the conversion of old and new kinetic energy. High-quality development is development that implements new development concepts. Among the five major development concepts, """"innovation"""" ranks first. Adhering to innovation-driven and promoting the transformation of development momentum has always been an important task for high-quality development. Regardless of the adjustment and transformation of traditional momentum, China has been unswervingly promoting the transformation of old and new momentum. Just now, Director Kang Yi gave a detailed introduction to china’s achievements in high-quality development, especially innovation-driven development, last year. Here I will add a few more data. In 2023, the added value of china\'s equipment manufacturing industry above designated size increased by 6.8% over the previous year, playing a key role in promoting the stable recovery of industry; in 2023, a report released by the World Intellectual Property Organization showed that china\'s ranking in the Global Innovation Index rose to Ranked 12th, the number of the world\'s top 100 scientific and technological innovation clusters ranks first in the world for the first time. It can be said that new kinetic energy has become an important engine leading to high-quality development.",positive,positive,1,
"Secondly, last year, china\'s economy rebounded for the better, especially market demand and domestic demand, which recovered well. Everyone should have personal experience of this, especially as the driving role of demand has increased, the connection between china\'s supply and demand and the economic cycle have also improved. Continuously improving. Here are some data for your reference. In the fourth quarter, the product sales rate of china\'s industrial enterprises above designated size continued to remain above 97%, which rose to 98.4% in December; judging from the capacity utilization rate that reflects the status of production capacity utilization, in the four quarters of 2023, the industrial capacity utilization rate was respectively 74.3%, 74.5%, 75.6% and 75.9%, showing a trend of recovery quarter by quarter. This reflects that as market demand improves, China\'s production capacity utilization is gradually recovering. At the beginning of this year, we also noticed that ice and snow tourism, ice and snow sports, etc. can be said to be """"out of the circle"""". This not only conforms to the general trend of upgrading residents\' consumption structure, but also demonstrates the potential of china\'s domestic demand. We are optimistic about the recovery of the consumer market this year. Full of expectation and confidence.",positive,positive,1,
"Overall, our country is still in a critical period of economic recovery, transformation and upgrading. In the next step, we must follow the decisions and arrangements of the Central Economic Work Conference, persist in seeking progress while maintaining stability, promote stability by promoting stability, establish first and then break, continue to consolidate and enhance the positive trend of economic recovery, and promote the economy to achieve effective improvement in quality and reasonable growth in quantity. .

"What I want to ask is, last year we saw the impact of real estate on the entire macro economy. Can it remain stable this year? Thanks.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. Real estate has always attracted much attention. At my press conference last year, a reporter also mentioned this issue. Everyone is very concerned about how the trend is going and what the next step will be. According to our monitoring, after more than 20 years of development, the real estate market is in the process of adjustment and transformation. Against such a broad background, all regions and departments are adapting to the new situation of major changes in the supply and demand relationship in the real estate market, and are adjusting and optimizing real estate policies in a timely manner. Judging from the current situation, there have been some positive changes in the real estate market, mainly in two aspects:",positive,positive,1,
"First, the decline in indicators such as real estate investment and sales narrowed. In 2023, real estate development investment will decrease by 9.6% compared with the previous year, and the decline will narrow by 0.4 percentage points compared with the previous year. The funds in place for real estate development enterprises fell by 13.6%, a decline that was 12.3 percentage points narrower than the previous year. The decline in commercial housing sales has significantly narrowed. In 2023, the sales area of \u200b\u200bcommercial housing nationwide will decrease by 8.5% compared with the previous year, and sales will decrease by 6.5%. Both are declining, but the declines are significantly narrowed by 15.8 and 20.2 percentage points respectively compared with the previous year. Since August, the number of online registrations for new commercial residential properties has rebounded overall, with an increase of 20.2 percentage points in December compared with August. According to the monitoring situation in 70 large and medium-sized cities, the transaction volume of new and second-hand houses is rising moderately. Second, the completed area of \u200b\u200breal estate has increased rapidly. The work of """"guaranteing the handover of buildings"""" is advancing steadily, and the results continue to show. In 2023, the area of \u200b\u200bcompleted housing by real estate development companies will increase by 17% compared with the previous year.",positive,positive,1,
How do you see the future trend of the real estate market? Our country’s real estate market has a relatively good foundation for long-term and healthy development. There are several reasons:,neutral,positive,0,positive
"First, there is still a lot of room for improvement in the quantity and quality of urbanization. It was just announced that the urbanization rate in 2023 will be 66.16%. Compared with the level of about 80% in developed economies, there is still room for improvement of more than 10 points. China\'s urbanization is still in the process of continuous development. The urbanization rate has increased by an average annual rate of 0.93 percentage points in the past five years. More than 10 million rural residents will enter cities and towns every year. The scale of new citizens is relatively large, which will also bring a large demand for new housing. In terms of stock, although the per capita housing area in our country is already large, many houses have unreasonable functions and structures. Many people have an urgent need for improved housing. This will also form an important driving force for the real estate market, including those currently monitored. In 70 large and medium-sized cities, the demand for improved housing is very obvious, as shown in the fact that the transaction volume of second-hand houses in 70 large and medium-sized cities has exceeded the transaction volume of new houses.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"Second, there is huge potential to build a new model of real estate development. A new model of real estate development is being actively constructed. This is a fundamental solution to solve real estate development problems and promote the healthy development of real estate. Among them, the construction of affordable housing, the construction of """"both leisure and emergency"""" public infrastructure, and the renovation of urban villages are all advancing rapidly. With the vigorous and orderly advancement of these projects, they will help solve the people\'s urgent, difficult and anxious problems in housing and living. At the same time, they will also drive real estate-related investment and consumption and promote the healthy development of the real estate market. Thanks.",positive,positive,1,

"Recently, many international institutions and business institutions have raised their expectations for China\'s economic growth, believing that China will still be the largest engine of global economic growth. What do you think of this? What will be the trend of China\'s economy in 2024? Thanks.",neutral,positive,0,positive
"Thank you for your question. How to view China\'s economic trend in 2024 is also a question of great concern to everyone. 2024 is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People\'s Republic of China. It is a critical year for us to implement the """"14th Five-Year Plan"""". To predict the economic trend of this year, we must first see that we will face some challenges and difficulties, but more are favorable conditions and advantages. Taken together, the opportunities we face outweigh the challenges, and the favorable conditions outweigh the unfavorable factors. The basic trend of long-term improvement of China\'s economy has not changed, and the factors and conditions supporting the high-quality development of China\'s economy are constantly accumulating and increasing. Therefore, we predict that China’s economy will continue to rebound and improve in 2024. Specifically, there are five favorable conditions.",positive,positive,1,
"First, economic growth has “good momentum.” In the four quarters of 2023, GDP has been growing positively year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, and the scale of the economy is also expanding quarter by quarter. This rebound is also relatively good. In addition to statistical accounting of economic aggregates, the National Bureau of Statistics also performs a task of monitoring and comparing some physical indicators. From the perspective of physical volume indicators, the absolute volume of most physical volume indicators such as electricity generation and consumption, output of major industrial products, investment, import and export, etc., greatly exceeded the level of 2019. Some physical volume indicators are lower than the pre-epidemic level in 2019, mainly due to the issue mentioned by the reporter just now, which is the output indicators of real estate-related products. This also reflects that our economic performance is improving as a whole. International organizations have raised their forecasts for china\'s economic growth. The International Monetary Fund has raised their forecasts by 0.4 percentage points, and the OECD has raised their forecasts by 0.1 percentage points. This shows that the international community is optimistic about China\'s economic development prospects in 2024.",positive,positive,1,
"Second, economic development is “resilient”. Our country has a strong industrial foundation. It is the only country that has all industrial categories in the United Nations industrial classification. The supporting capabilities and integration advantages of the industry are outstanding. The added value of our manufacturing industry accounts for nearly 1/3 of the world\'s total, and our exports of goods account for 1/3 of the world\'s total. The proportion of the world is 1/7. At the same time, china\'s infrastructure networks such as transportation and communications are increasingly improving, weak areas such as education and medical care are constantly being strengthened, and the quality of supply of factors such as talents and funds is significantly improved.

"In 2023, the total retail sales of consumer goods will show a gradual recovery trend. However, our country is still facing the problem of insufficient demand. How do you view the performance of the consumer market in 2023? What are your predictions for 2024? Can the recovery in consumption continue? Thanks.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. The first question is about the performance of the consumer market in 2023, and the second question is about the prediction of the consumer market in 2024.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Let me first introduce the performance of the consumer market in 2023. Generally speaking, the consumer market will recover in 2023. The consumer market has been greatly affected by the epidemic in the past three years, and many contact-based and gathering-based consumption have been suppressed. With the smooth transition of epidemic prevention and control, the economy and society have fully returned to normal operations, and consumption has shown a good recovery trend. Hotspots Frequently, consumption will become an important force driving economic recovery in 2023. There are several characteristics: First, the scale of consumption has reached a new high. In 2023, the total retail sales of consumer goods will exceed 47 trillion yuan, reaching a record high. Second, consumption has once again become the main driving force of economic growth. In 2023, final consumption expenditure will drive economic growth by 4.3 percentage points, an increase of 3.1 percentage points from the previous year, and its contribution to economic growth will be 82.5%, an increase of 43.1 percentage points. The basic role of consumption will become more significant. Third, service consumption recovered quickly. The rapid recovery of service consumption is also a highlight of consumption recovery in 2023. Service retail sales increased by 20% over the previous year, 14.2 percentage points faster than the retail sales of goods; residents’ per capita service consumption expenditure increased by 14.4%, accounting for 14.4% of residents’ per capita consumption. The proportion of expenditure reached 45.2%, an increase of 2 percentage points from the previous year. Fourth, the structural upgrading of residents’ consumption continues. In particular, with the improvement of people\'s living standards and the steady growth of income, our country is currently in a period of rapid upgrading of residents\' consumption structure.",positive,positive,1,
"What will happen in the next stage? We judge that there are many favorable conditions to support the continued recovery of consumption, and consumption will still maintain good growth. Supporting factors: First, the consumption potential is still huge. With a population of more than 1.4 billion, the advantages of the ultra-large-scale market are still obvious. In addition, the integrated development of urban and rural areas, the advancement of urbanization process, and the continuous upgrading of the consumption structure have provided broad space for consumption growth. In particular, the consumption potential of medical and health services is expected to be further unleashed. Second, the consumption base has been continuously consolidated. Income is the premise and foundation of consumption. As the economy continues to recover and the employment situation improves overall, residents\' income is expected to maintain steady growth, which will strongly support the improvement of residents\' consumption ability. Third, consumption highlights continue to emerge. Digital consumption, green consumption, health consumption, entertainment consumption, etc. are all developing rapidly, and consumption hot spots such as smart homes, entertainment and tourism, sports events, and domestic trendy products are also continuing to heat up, constantly adding impetus to the improvement and expansion of the consumer market. Fourth, policies to promote consumption continue to be implemented. All regions and departments insist on prioritizing the recovery and expansion of consumption, and have successively introduced a series of consumption-promoting policies, focusing on stabilizing and expanding traditional consumption, cultivating and strengthening new consumption, and continuing to optimize the consumption environment. They will continue to play a role in stabilizing the consumer market and promoting the recovery of consumption. to a positive effect. Therefore, we remain optimistic about consumption trends in 2024.

I would like to pay attention to the situation of the fifth national economic census. The fifth national economic census was officially launched on January 1 this year. What is the current progress? What are the innovations of this census compared with the previous four censuses? How to ensure census data quality? Thanks.,neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. The fifth national economic census is the last major survey of national conditions and strength in the new era and new journey. It carries the important task of understanding china\'s economic situation and reflecting high-quality development progress. Current progress, the unit inventory work has been successfully completed, and the census registration stage will be entered from January 1, 2024. The census registration work is now being carried out in an orderly manner. Especially since this year has entered the new year, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang visited Beijing to conduct research and guide on-site census registration on January 3, visited and expressed condolences to grassroots enumerators and staff, and also put forward clear requirements for the census registration work. Currently, the census work is advancing in an orderly manner. January to April this year is the official registration stage of the census, and it is also the most important stage of the census work. It is the most important stage for obtaining high-quality census data.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"Regarding the innovation points of this year’s fifth national economic census, it mainly focuses on the high-quality development of services, enriches survey content, and innovates survey methods. The fifth national economic census will comprehensively investigate the development scale, layout and benefits of china\'s secondary and tertiary industries. On this basis, we must expand the field of statistical investigation, enrich the content of statistical investigation, improve the statistical investigation system, and promote the construction of a statistical monitoring system for high-quality development. There are three main aspects of innovation:",positive,neutral,0,positive
"First, for the first time, an input-output survey was carried out in a coordinated manner. Originally, the input-output survey and the economic census were conducted separately. The fifth national economic census integrated these two separate surveys, which will help promote better connection between economic aggregate data and structural data.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"The second is to further improve the “three new” economic statistics. The newly added digital economy survey content will better reflect the digitalization process of china\'s economic development, systematically promote the platform economic survey, and lay the foundation for clarifying the development of new industries, new business formats, and new development models.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"The third is innovation in investigation methods. We continued to deepen the application of departmental administrative records, added independent reporting methods to collect census data, developed a mobile app for the first time to collect data, and established an electronic ledger for input and output statistics for the first time to improve the efficiency of census work.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"Census data quality is the most fundamental criterion for measuring the success or failure of the census. During the census work, we attach great importance to the quality of the census data and have adopted a series of measures to ensure the quality of the census data.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"The first is to standardize data collection. This economic census uses a combination of household collection by enumerators, independent reporting by census subjects, and data submission by departments to obtain data on census subjects. Human interference in the data collection process is strictly controlled to ensure the quality of census source data.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The second is to carry out data audit and inspection in various ways. We carry out reporting and review of census data, comprehensively use big data means and multiple analysis methods to carry out review and verification, and organize on-site verification and inspections in a timely manner. After the census registration is completed, the Economic Census Office will also organize post-event quality inspections to comprehensively inspect the quality of the census registration data.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"The third is to resolutely investigate and deal with fraud. Conduct censuses in accordance with the law, resolutely resist all acts of interfering with census data, strengthen statistical law enforcement inspections, incorporate the fifth national economic census into statistical supervision, """"hit"""" violations of laws and disciplines during the census as soon as they appear, and strictly pursue accountability in accordance with laws and regulations Accountability.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"Currently, there are approximately more than 2.1 million census workers (census enumerators and census counselors) across the country, visiting the streets and alleys, going deep into enterprises and merchants to collect data, and census data are also being reported in an orderly manner.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"Here, I would also like to thank all census subjects for their support and census workers for their hard work. I also hope that friends from the media will continue to support the census, publicize the census, and supervise the census. Let us work together to carry out the fifth national economic census with high quality. The census work produced a satisfactory answer sheet. Thanks.",positive,neutral,0,positive
"Time relationship, the last two questions.",neutral,neutral,1,
"The picture shows Shou Xiaoli, deputy director and spokesperson of the Information Bureau of the State Council Information Office, inviting reporters to ask questions. (Photo by Luan Haijun)",neutral,neutral,1,
"Recently, media reported that in the first 11 months of 2023, there was a difference of 294.6 billion kilowatt-hours between electricity consumption and power generation. Why is there such a data difference? Thanks.",neutral,neutral,1,
"Thank you for your question. We have noticed that some media discuss the difference between electricity consumption and power generation. Power generation and power consumption are two important indicators that reflect the operation of electricity. Just now, this journalist friend mentioned that the difference in the January-November data between these two statistical indicators is mainly due to the different calibers of the two indicators. One of these two indicators is the electricity consumption of the whole society, and the other is the power generation of industrial enterprises above designated size. In addition to industrial enterprises above designated size, with the rapid development of solar power and wind power, some industrial enterprises below designated size, various residential buildings, and merchants also generate electricity. However, this power generation is not included in the power generation of industrial enterprises above designated size from January to November.",negative,neutral,0,neutral
"In order to give everyone a better understanding, I will give a little explanation on these two indicators. Their survey objects, statistical caliber, and coverage are different. First, the statistical caliber is different. The electricity consumption of the whole society is counted from the user side of electricity, while the industrial power generation above designated size is counted from the supplier side. The scope of these two statistics is different. Specifically speaking, the electricity consumption statistics of the whole society are full-scale electricity consumption, that is, all electricity consumption, including the electricity consumption of enterprises, residents, and power plants. Self-produced electricity, line loss, etc.; the statistical caliber of industrial power generation above designated size is the power generation of industrial enterprises above designated size. The current standard for industrial enterprises above designated size is industrial enterprises with an annual main business income of 20 million yuan or more, so it It does not include the power generation of small industrial power generation enterprises below designated size, and is not a full-scale power generation capacity.",,neutral,,
"The second is affected by some distributed power generation. In recent years, widely dispersed and small-scale distributed solar and wind power generation have developed rapidly, and are mostly distributed in various residential buildings, commercial households and some industrial enterprises below designated size. This part of the power generation has not reached the level of 10% due to the small scale of power generation enterprises. According to the statistical standards for industrial enterprises above designated size, some are still businesses and residential buildings, so they are not included in the monthly power generation of industrial enterprises above designated size, but will be included in the power generation of the whole society. As everyone knows, our data is usually released in the middle of the next month. With so many small power generation capacities scattered across various places, we will conduct annual statistics, and we also publish the power generation of the whole society in the annual statistical bulletin. Generally speaking, industrial power generation above designated size accounts for about 95% of the total power generation in society. It has been fluctuating recently, while power generation below designated size is increasing, and power generation above designated size is gradually decreasing, but the decrease is not significant. It is about this proportion. When looking at power generation on a monthly basis, we cannot ignore the expression """"industrial production above designated size."""" Statistical indicators are relatively rigorous, and everyone should also pay attention to the meaning and scope of statistical indicators when using them, so as to use the data more accurately.

I would like to ask what the employment situation will be like in 2023? Has the target task been completed? The number of college graduates in the Class of 2024 is expected to hit a new high. What will be the employment trend? Thanks.,,neutral,,
"Thank you for your question. Employment is also an issue of great concern to everyone because it is the greatest livelihood issue. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have always attached great importance to the issue of employment, emphasizing that employment stabilization should be taken into strategic and comprehensive consideration. All regions and departments insist on giving priority to employment and optimize and adjust employment stabilization policies and measures. In the past year, we have made every effort to stabilize the overall employment situation, and the employment situation has generally improved. It has several characteristics.",,positive,,
"First, the surveyed unemployment rate fell and new jobs continued to increase. On a quarterly basis, the quarterly averages of the national urban surveyed unemployment rate are 5.4%, 5.2%, 5.2%, and 5.0% respectively. The trend of gradual improvement in employment is relatively obvious. The number of new urban jobs from January to November was 11.8 million, an increase of 350,000 year-on-year.",,positive,,
"Second, there are strong employment guarantees for key groups and disadvantaged groups. A series of job stabilization support and job expansion incentive measures have come into effect, and the effectiveness of classified assistance to groups with employment difficulties has been outstanding. The employment of migrant workers, young people, people with employment difficulties and other groups has been effectively guaranteed. In 2023, the total number of migrant workers will reach 297.53 million, an increase of 1.91 million over the previous year. The average urban surveyed unemployment rate for the migrant agricultural household registration population is 4.9%, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points from the previous year. From January to November, 4.75 million urban unemployed people were re-employed, and 1.56 million people with employment difficulties were employed.",,positive,,
"Third, the employment scale of people lifted out of poverty has increased steadily. All regions and departments have given full play to the role of the east-west labor cooperation, counterpart assistance, targeted assistance and other mechanisms, and carried out in-depth special assistance in key counties and relocation poverty alleviation. The employment of the people who have been lifted out of poverty has grown steadily. By the end of November 2023, all people will be lifted out of poverty. The number of migrant workers is 32.94 million, exceeding the target of 30 million.",,positive,,
"Regarding the employment situation this year, the general judgment is that pressure still exists, and structural contradictions in the employment of some groups and industries will still be prominent. However, as the economy rebounds and improves, industrial transformation and upgrading accelerates, and positive factors for stabilizing employment are also accumulating, china\'s employment situation is expected to remain stable. There are several reasons:",,neutral,,
"First, the expansion of economic scale brings about increased employment. Economic growth is the basis for stabilizing and expanding employment. In recent years, the continuous expansion of china\'s economic growth is the key to driving employment growth. The growth of china\'s economic growth in 2024 is expected to be greater than last year, which will provide strong support for employment expansion. Second, the size of the population exiting the labor market in 2024 will be larger than the size of the population newly entering the labor market, which also provides more employment space for people looking for work. The third is to upgrade the industrial structure to expand employment capacity. Compared with other industries, the service industry with high labor intensity has obvious advantages in attracting employment. Since last year, the service industry has been recovering well, and its proportion in GDP has also increased. The proportion of the service industry in GDP has exceeded the level before the epidemic. The employment-driving role of catering, transportation, wholesale and retail industries is relatively obvious. Looking forward to this year, service consumption will be relatively active, and the growth of the service industry will continue to be one of the main forces driving employment. At the same time, new industries, new business formats, and new business models are booming, creating many new job demands, which is also conducive to expanding employment space and improving employment quality. Fourth, the effects of employment stabilization policies continue to be effective. The Central Economic Work Conference also made arrangements for this, specifically calling for more policies that are conducive to stabilizing expectations, stabilizing growth, and stabilizing employment. All regions and departments will give greater priority to employment and increase employment assistance for key groups. The release of policy dividends is also expected to continue to provide a strong guarantee for employment stability. Thanks.",,positive,,

There are three aspects worth focusing on this week.,,neutral,,
"First, the major state-owned banks lowered their deposit interest rates for the third time this year, which will help ease the pressure on banks' net interest margins and open up space for subsequent interest rate cuts. Starting from December 21, the five major state-owned commercial banks including Industry, Agriculture, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Communications Bank successively issued announcements to lower the listed deposit interest rates. The listed interest rates for three-month, six-month and one-year time deposits were reduced by 0.1 percentage points, and the listed interest rates for three-year and five-year time deposits were reduced by 0.25 percentage points. This round of deposit interest rate adjustment is the third reduction this year, which will help reduce banks’ liability-side costs and reduce the pressure on net interest margins. According to data from the State Administration of Financial Supervision, as of 2023Q3, the net interest margin of commercial banks dropped to 1.73%, the lowest value since data was disclosed in 2010. At the same time, further reductions in liability-side costs have also opened up room for asset-side costs to fall, and an interest rate cut in 2024 may be on the way. The decline in deposit interest rates will, to a certain extent, help transform residents' savings into consumption and investment, and promote a virtuous economic cycle.",,positive,,
"Second, the list of projects for the second batch of additional government bond issuances has been released, which is expected to result in physical workload and boost economic expectations. According to news released by the National Development and Reform Commission on the 23rd, the National Development and Reform Commission recently consulted with relevant departments to issue a list of the second batch of projects for the issuance of additional treasury bonds in 2023. It involves more than 9,600 additional treasury bond issuance projects, and plans to arrange more than 560 billion yuan in treasury bond funds. So far, the first two batches of projects have involved arranging for the issuance of additional treasury bonds exceeding 800 billion yuan, and most of the 1 trillion yuan in additional issuance of treasury bonds have been implemented in specific projects. In particular, the accelerated implementation of national debt is expected to continue to generate physical workload and bring real momentum to the real economy.",,positive,,

The PCE in November was 3.2% year-on-year, lower than expected (3.3%), and the core PCE was 0.1% month-on-month, also lower than expected (0.2%). PCE data shows that inflationary pressure in the United States has slowed down and the probability of a soft landing has increased. After the data was released, the market's probability of the Federal Reserve starting to cut interest rates in March 2024 rose to 76%, and there may be room for a 150BP rate cut throughout the year.

Among them, the tail-off impact of last year's price changes was approximately -0.2 percentage points, unchanged from the previous month; the impact of new price increases was approximately 0 percentage points, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Falling food prices are the main reason for the fall in CPI. The specific manifestations are as follows: Affected by sufficient market supply and seasonal decline in consumer demand, food prices continue to drag down CPI year-on-year performance. Affected by the drop in travel demand after the holiday, service prices dragged down non-food prices. However, affected by the increase in international crude oil prices, the prices of industrial consumer goods continued to rise. In addition, the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6% year-on-year, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, indicating moderate consumer demand. We predict that the CPI in October will be -0.2% year-on-year, which is consistent with the announced results and in line with expectations.",,neutral,,
"In October 2023, PPI fell by 2.6% year-on-year, down 0.1 percentage points from the previous month, and remained unchanged month-on-month, down by 0.4 percentage points from the previous month. Among them, the upward impact of last year's price changes was -0.4 percentage points, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from the previous month; the impact of new price increases was approximately -2.2 percentage points, an increase of 0.1 percentage points from the previous month. The increase in the price of upstream raw materials combined with the fall in demand for industrial products has become the main reason for the basically unchanged decline in PPI. The specific manifestations are as follows: Affected by the continued rise in international crude oil prices, the prices of upstream industrial products continue to rise month-on-month, while the fall in demand for mid-stream and downstream industrial products drives up the price of daily necessities There was a month-on-month decrease. We predict that PPI will fall by 2.7% year-on-year in October, which is 0.1 percentage point higher than the published result. The main source of the error is the overestimation of the price of industrial production materials and data accuracy issues.",,neutral,,
"Generally speaking, on the residential consumption side, the rise in international oil prices has driven the price of industrial consumer goods to strengthen, and the increase in food prices is in line with seasonality, causing the CPI to decline month-on-month. On the industrial production side, the rise in upstream raw material prices and the fall in demand for industrial products caused the year-on-year decline in PPI to remain basically unchanged. In general, cost push and weak demand performance are the main characteristics of this month's price performance.",,negative,,
"Main data: From January to November 2023, the national general public budget revenue was 20.01 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of 7.9% (previous value: 8.1%). The actual year-on-year growth rate after excluding the factor of retained tax refunds was -0.4% (previous value) Value: -0.8%). General public budget expenditures were 23.84 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of 4.9% (previous value: 4.6%). From January to November, the national government fund budget revenue was 5.18 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of -13.8% (previous value: -16.0%), and the government fund budget expenditure was 8.31 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of -13.3% (Previous value: -15.1%).",,neutral,,
"1. The growth rate of general public budget revenue remains stable, and the budget revenue target is expected to be basically achieved throughout the year. The cumulative year-on-year growth rate of national public budget revenue from January to November was 7.9%. Overall, the recovery of this year's first-account budget revenue is mainly due to the sharp rebound in value-added tax after the end of the value-added tax refund and the continued increase in vehicle purchase tax. High growth pull. Among the remaining major taxes, such as corporate income tax, consumption tax, customs duties, and real estate taxes, they all made negative contributions to the growth rate of public budget revenue throughout the year. In terms of marginal changes in itemized taxes, the growth rates of corporate income tax and consumption tax have improved, with year-on-year increases of 9.91% and 4.16% respectively for the month (previous values: 0.6%, -3.44%). Stamp tax was affected by tax rate adjustments at -45.53% year-on-year. . So far, the revenue from one account has completed 91.1% of the full-year progress. According to the seasonal patterns of previous years, we estimate that the completion progress of public budget revenue in December will be around 8%-9%, and the budget target for the whole year will be basically completed.",,neutral,,
"2. Expenditures continue to increase, and the structure is further tilted towards infrastructure, which strongly supports the achievement of economic goals throughout the year. With the issuance and release of special refinancing bonds and new trillion-dollar treasury bonds, fiscal expenditures have increased significantly since October. From January to November, general public budget expenditures increased by 4.9% year-on-year. The growth rate was 4.6% in the previous month. On the basis of continuing to increase efforts, the fiscal expenditure intensity in November reached 119.2%, which has significantly exceeded the average of the past five years (117%). In terms of expenditure structure, this month has further tilted towards infrastructure construction. The total amount of the four fiscal expenditures related to infrastructure construction from January to November is 5.22 trillion. The cumulative year-on-year growth rate has continued to rise to 2.98% since turning from negative to positive in August, which is a strong support. Economic growth has rebounded since the bottom in the third quarter. Looking forward to the whole year, we expect that in December, whether supported by seasonal peaks or new trillions of treasury bonds, fiscal expenditure intensity and spending on infrastructure are expected to further increase, slightly exceeding the budget target.",,positive,,
"3. The seasonal peak of land transfer revenue combined with the recovery of the primary market has eased the pressure on broad fiscal revenue. From January to November, government fund income was 5.18 trillion yuan, a cumulative year-on-year decrease of -13.8%, and the cumulative decline for the whole year narrowed by 2.2 percentage points from the previous month. Among them, land transfer fee income was 4.2 trillion yuan, a cumulative year-on-year decrease of 17.9%, and the decline narrowed by 2.6 percentage points. The two months at the end of each year are the peaks of local government land transfer. According to the average level in the past five years, November and December accounted for about 30% of the annual land transfer revenue, of which November accounted for about 10%, and December accounted for about 30%. About 20%. The land revenue in November this year was 714.7 billion yuan, which has exceeded the absolute value level in the past 18 and 19 years, and the growth rate has also exceeded simple seasonal factors, reflecting the current stabilization of the primary land market. This is also confirmed in the urban land use tax and cultivated land occupation tax related to land development. The cumulative year-on-year decline of the two has significantly narrowed, and the year-on-year growth rate in that month has increased significantly to 15.67% and 50% (previous value). :6.89%, 21.21%). On December 14, Shanghai and Beijing adjusted their home purchase policies at the same time. We believe that land revenue in December can be relatively optimistic, supported by the dual factors of seasonality and market stabilization.",,positive,,
"4. In summary, the gap between the annual fiscal revenue and expenditure compared with the budget at the beginning of the year is only land revenue. So far this year, 1.33 trillion yuan of special refinancing bonds worth 1.5 trillion yuan have been issued, and most of the new trillion-dollar treasury bonds have been issued. Looking forward to the completion of the annual fiscal budget revenue and expenditure, there is currently less pressure to achieve the budget target for fiscal revenue and expenditure in one account. Under the policy increase, public fiscal expenditure is even expected to slightly exceed the budget target. So far, this year’s budget gap only lies in the second account. Although government fund budget revenue has eased due to seasonal peak factors, the overall decline is still relatively large compared to last year. We estimate that the completion of the government infrastructure revenue budget for the whole year is at Between 85% and 90%, corresponding to an uncollected amount of approximately 800-1200 billion. However, considering the incremental policies totaling approximately 2.5 trillion this year, fiscal intensity is still significantly higher than last year.",,neutral,,

From a fiscal perspective, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance pointed out in his answer to reporters\' questions that for the 400 billion yuan special treasury bonds due on August 29, 2024, the Ministry of Finance will continue the practice of previous years and continue to adopt a rolling issuance method to issue special treasury bonds due in 2024 to relevant banks and other institutions, and the funds raised will be used to repay the principal due that month. From the perspective of the central bank, the People\'s Bank of China conducted a spot bond buyout transaction in the open market business by means of quantity bidding, and bought 400 billion yuan of special treasury bonds from primary dealers in the open market business.

"Economic growth in the first quarter exceeded expectations, with prices, manufacturing, and service industries driving its upward trend. (1) Real GDP grew by 5.3% in the first quarter, exceeding market expectations and far behind nominal GDP (4.2%). The price deflator in the first quarter was -1.27%, and prices were the main reason why actual GDP exceeded expectations. (2) The growth rate of GDP deviates from the growth rate of industrial production. We believe that the contribution of the service industry to GDP is increasing. The growth rate of the service industry increased in the first quarter, and the Spring Festival and Qingming Festival tourism and movie box office revenue performed well.

Risk warning: Overseas monetary policy exceeds expectations and geopolitical factors exceed expectations.,,neutral,,
"1. Background knowledgeAs we know, the means used by the state to regulate and control the macroeconomy are divided into monetary policy and fiscal policy. Among them, monetary policy is mainly aimed at money supply and interest rate, and it is necessary to control both at a level suitable for the country's economic development.(1) Money supply and interest rates1. Money supplyIf there is too much money supply in the market, this excess of money will look for investment outlets. But this money is superfluous, and it is not appropriate where to go. As a result, there will be many problems in the place where these funds go, and even in the entire market, such as inflation, investment overheating, bubbles, etc. At this point, the central bank has to find a way to reduce the money supply.2. Interest RatesInterest rates affect the cost of borrowing money. If the economy is overheated, people are investing, and banks are lending out. At this time, the disorderly investment makes economic growth in an extensive and inefficient state, which will lead to the """"""""double inflation"""""""" of investment and credit, thereby exacerbating economic fluctuations. At this time, the central bank will find a way to raise interest rates.3. The relationship between the money supply and interest ratesIn addition, according to the principles of macroeconomics, the money supply and the level of interest rates are closely linked: when the money supply rises, interest rates fall.4. A tool for regulating the money supply and interest ratesSLF, MLF, SLO, PSL are tools used by central banks to regulate the money supply and interest rates.(2) Mortgage loans and repurchases1. Mortgage loansBy providing mortgages to commercial banks, central banks can inject money into the market.The main method is that commercial banks pledge their high-rated assets such as commercial papers, securities, and credit assets (creditor's rights) to the central bank to obtain money.2. RepurchasesThrough repurchases, the central bank can regulate the amount of money in the market over a period of time. For example, a commercial bank sells an asset (e.g., commercial paper) to the central bank and enters into an agreement with the central bank to buy it back at a slightly higher price at a certain date in the future. The above-mentioned operations are called """"""""positive repo"""""""" from the perspective of commercial banks and """"""""reverse repo"""""""" from the perspective of the central bank. On the contrary, if the central bank and the commercial bank carry out the opposite operation of the above operation, the central bank will carry out the repurchase and the commercial bank will carry out the reverse repurchase.If the central bank reposes, i.e. the central bank lends money to commercial banks, the supply of money in the market increases. If the central bank is buying back, i.e., the merchant is borrowing money from commercial banks, the market money supply decreases.2. SLFThe full name of SLF is Standing Lending Facility, and the Chinese name is """"""""Standing Lending Facility."""""""" It is commonly known as """"""""hot and sour noodles"""""""". It is a liquidity adjustment tool created by the central bank in 2013. In early 2013, the People's Bank of China created the Standing Lending Facility, which was piloted in some provinces and cities, making it the earliest category of any innovative liquidity instrument. On February 11, 2015, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) promoted the Standing Lending Facility for Branches across the country. SLF falls under the previously mentioned mortgages.Features of SLF:SLF is provided by the local central branches of the People's Bank of China to provide official liquidity support to local central small financial institutions, rather than being directly operated by the central bank. So it is more convenient in operation. Many of the processes of SLF are similar to re-lending, and in the process of local central bank sub-branches, SLF and re-lending are often collectively referred to as """"""""re-lending"""""""", and the management of collateral is also the same as that of re-lending.SLF is mainly issued to policy banks and national commercial banks.Eligible collateral for SLF includes treasury bonds, central bank bills, CDB and policy financial bonds, and high-grade corporate credit bonds. The central bank has a certain collateral ratio to control risk.SLFs are initiated by financial institutions, and financial institutions can apply according to their own liquidity needs.When financial institutions need money, they can apply for SLF from the central bank on a """"""""one-to-one"""""""" basis and make a mortgage loan to obtain money, which is highly targeted. The traditional open market operation is the central bank's market-oriented means to inject liquidity into the primary dealer, which belongs to macroeconomic adjustment. On the other hand, SLF designates a trading partner and aims to solve the liquidity needs of a specific financial institution, which is a micro intervention.The interest rate of SLF is generally 1-3 months, and the interest rate of the loan is set by the central bank according to the needs of monetary policy and the need to guide market interest rates. Since SLF is designed to stabilize short-term interest rates, the approval process is quicker, and even shorter terms can be disbursed on the same day.SLF can be used to regulate the market's short-term money supply and interest rates.3. MLFThe full name of MLF is Medium-term Lending Facility, and the Chinese name is """"""""Medium-term Lending Facility"""""""", commonly known as """"""""Mala Spicy Powder"""""""". The central bank created the MLF in September 2014 as a monetary policy tool for the central bank to provide medium-term base money. The MLF rate plays the role of the medium-term policy rate.Features of MLF:MLFs, like SLFs, fall under the previously mentioned mortgages. The collateral is generally treasury bonds, central bank bills, policy financial bonds, local bonds, high-grade credit bonds, small and micro, green and """"""""three rural"""""""" financial bonds, green loans, etc.The difference is that MLFs have a somewhat longer loan tenure. It is usually 3 months, 6 months or 1 year, but in reality it is most widely used for 1 year. If the loan is about to expire, the financial institution can re-agree with the central bank on the interest rate and make a new round of loans at the new interest rate.The target of MLF issuance is the same as that of SLF, and commercial banks that meet the requirements of macro-prudential can apply for MLF from the central bank.The central bank has requirements for the use of MLF funds, and requires financial institutions to invest the funds borrowed from MLF into the """"""""three rural"""""""" and small and micro enterprises, which is a kind of support measure for the """"""""three rural"""""""" and small and micro enterprises.Since its creation, MLF has been the most important tool in the central bank's base money delivery, and it has been used very frequently, which can be understood as an important alternative to RRR cuts. It is an important tool for balancing the central bank's balance sheet after the central bank's foreign exchange easing stops growing or even falls.MLF is used to regulate the money supply and interest rates in the medium term. MLFs contribute to the reduction of social financing costs by adjusting the cost of medium-term financing to financial institutions to have an impact on financial institutions' balance sheets and market expectations. In addition, LPR pricing also refers to the MLF rate.However, after the use of monetary policy, it is often difficult to recover it. This pattern is also reflected in MLF. In the past few years, MLF has often played a role as a tool for the central bank to stabilize the market, and in the event of large market fluctuations, the central bank will add new amounts of MLF in addition to the existing MLF to stabilize the market. For example, the first substantial increase at the end of 2015 in order to alleviate the shortage of funds at the end of the year, the second sharp increase was from November to December 2016, in order to rescue the leverage of the bond market due to the violent deleveraging of the debt disaster, a large injection of 1.3 trillion incremental MLF in 2 months.Fourth, SLOThe full name of SLO is Short-term Liquidity Operations, and the Chinese name is """"""""short-term liquidity adjustment tool"""""""", commonly known as """"""""sour and spicy lotus"""""""". In January 2013, the People's Bank of China decided to use the open market short-term liquidity adjustment tool as a necessary supplement to the regular operation of the open market, in order to further improve the open market operation mechanism, improve the flexibility and initiative of the open market operation, and promote the smooth operation of the liquidity of the banking system and money market interest rates.There are generally two ways for central banks to release water to the market, the aforementioned SLF and MLF belong to """"""""lending"""""""", while SLO belongs to """"""""buying and selling"""""""".Features of SLOs:SLO is mainly based on positive repurchase and reverse repurchase with a term of less than seven days, and the operation period can be appropriately extended in case of holidays.Repo refers to the transaction behavior of the central bank selling securities to primary dealers and agreeing to buy back the securities on a specific date in the future. Repo is the operation of the central bank to withdraw liquidity from the market.Reverse repo refers to the act of the central bank purchasing securities from primary dealers and agreeing to sell the securities to primary dealers at a specific date in the future. Reverse repo is the operation of the central bank to inject liquidity into the market.SLOs are not materially different from normal open market operations, except that they are shorter (1-7 days) and more frequent and flexible.SLO operates with large state-owned banks or joint-stock banks, which are better financial institutions among primary dealers. The central bank uses SLOs to regulate the ultra-short-term money supply and interest rates for up to seven days. Every Tuesday and Thursday, the central bank generally conducts open market operations, and the main one at present is the repurchase operation. During the Spring Festival in 2016, the central bank improved the frequency of traditional open market operations, from the previous open market operations twice a week, to the central bank can make decisions on a daily basis. The interest rate of the SLO is determined by a market-based interest rate tender.5. PSLThe full name of PSL is Pledged Supplement Lending, which is commonly known as """"""""Pizza Blue"""""""" in Chinese.Features of PSLPSL is a low-cost mortgage loan provided by the central bank to policy banks (such as China Development Bank) in order to support the construction of some specific projects, and the term is generally 3-5 years. In addition to supporting certain items, PSL processing is also used to put money into the market and regulate medium-term market interest rates.6. The difference between using innovative liquidity tools and RRR cutsInnovative liquidity tools mainly include SLF, MLF, PSL, SLO, TMLF, TLF, CRA. The most commonly used of these are SLF, MLF and PSL. SLOs are also used a lot, and other tools are unconventional, and some have only been used once so far, which is not universal.First, there are two benefits to using innovative liquidity tools over raising or lowering interest rates outright, or raising or lowering reserve ratios. Take reverse repo as an example:On the one hand, it is more flexible. For example, it can invalidate the policy after one day through one-day operation, and then observe the effect, and then increase the code if it is not good, and it can be continuously scrolled with a high degree of flexibility.On the other hand, China's economy is facing a new normal, to maintain a certain economic growth rate depends on infrastructure investment and real estate investment, the development of the real economy also needs banks and loans, direct interest rate hikes The government is worried that it will impact economic growth, so it does not dare to raise interest rates rashly. However, using reverse repo to adjust market liquidity will not send too strong signals and prevent the market from over-interpreting, which is a more efficient way.Second, the use of innovative liquidity tools expands the central bank's balance sheet. The RRR cut does not expand the balance sheet of the central bank, but only changes the structure of the base currency, but will stimulate commercial banks to increase credit supply, thereby expanding the balance sheets of commercial banks.Finally, compared with RRR cuts, innovative liquidity tools have a clear maturity date, and once the operation expires, commercial banks need to repay the borrowings from the central bank, which is actually a contraction of the base currency. Therefore, in many cases, these tools have a strong rigidity, that is, once they are released, the central bank must continue to do so in order to avoid monetary contraction when they expire. This has been fully demonstrated in the MLF over the past few years.",,neutral,,

"We have emphasized the pattern of """"high growth-high inflation-high interest rates"""" many times in recent reports.

Therefore, in the first quarter, the rise in interest rates caused by the resilience of the U.S. economy, the impact of rising inflation, and the correction of U.S. stocks were reflected in the weakening of the high-frequency financial conditions index, which was ultimately transmitted to the fall in GDP momentum. Our overall logic is that the U.S. economic trend is not significant, and marginal changes have become the focus of changes in macro sentiment and allocation paradigms. In this case, we need to pay attention to the forward-looking guiding role of the weakening (strengthening) FCI on economic momentum.",,neutral,,

It deepened by 0.3 percentage points in March. The overall decline in investment from January to April was less than expected, mainly due to the still deep decline in real estate investment and insufficient infrastructure construction. Manufacturing investment still maintains strong resilience.

New resident loans, new corporate loans and new non-bank loans were -590.7 billion yuan, 1.570 billion yuan and 404.5 billion yuan respectively, a year-on-year decrease of 798.8 billion yuan, a decrease of 40 billion yuan and an increase of 387.2 billion yuan respectively.",,neutral,,
"Looking at the combined January-February period, residents' credit increased slightly year-on-year, while residents' medium and long-term loans increased year-on-year.

"Although corporate credit increased less year-on-year, credit in January-February was still the second highest in the same period in history. New corporate loans in February were 1.57 trillion yuan, a slight decrease of 40 billion yuan year-on-year. The drag was mainly due to bill financing. Combined from January to February, new corporate loans were 5.43 trillion yuan, a decrease of 860 billion yuan year-on-year. The high base is the main reason. The first two new corporate loans this year were the second lowest in the same period in history.

"Fourth, in terms of deposits, new fiscal deposits decreased year-on-year, and corporate deposits decreased significantly year-on-year. New RMB deposits in February were 960 billion yuan, a decrease of 1.85 trillion yuan year-on-year. Corporate deposits and fiscal deposits were the main drag. Considering that the pre-holiday bonus distribution has disturbed the deposits of residents and enterprises, combined from January to February, the new deposits of residents and enterprises were 5.73 trillion yuan and -1.85 trillion yuan respectively, a year-on-year decrease of 1.2626 billion yuan and a decrease of 242.45 billion yuan respectively. 100 million yuan. The possible reasons are firstly that loans have declined year-on-year, and so have the deposits derived; secondly, that real estate sales have weakened, which has exerted a drag on corporate deposits.",,negative,,
"New fiscal deposits were significantly lower than government bond financing, indicating that fiscal spending may have been vigorous at the beginning of this year. In February this year, new government bond financing was 601.1 billion yuan, and fiscal deposits fell by 379.8 billion yuan; in the first two months, new government bond financing was 895.8 billion yuan, but fiscal deposits only increased by 480.6 billion yuan. Compared with the same period last year, new government bond financing in the first two months of this year decreased by 332 billion yuan year-on-year, while fiscal deposits decreased by 658 billion yuan year-on-year.

The large fluctuations in M1 growth rate are due to the impact of the Spring Festival in the wrong month. According to our calculations, excluding the impact of the Spring Festival in the wrong month, M1 in January was around 2.5% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline in M1 in February indicates that corporate expectations need to be further repaired.",,negative,,

Although the Japanese and Korean stock markets rebounded overall in the following four trading days, the Nikkei 225 index fell 2.46% and the Korea Composite Index fell 3.28% on the same day. The trigger for the sharp adjustment of the Japanese and Korean stock markets this time was mainly the Bank of Japan\'s interest rate hike and balance sheet reduction, coupled with the sharp appreciation of the yen against the US dollar in the short term, which led to the reversal of carry trades. However, the fundamental reason is that the Federal Reserve guided the market to expect a rate cut in September, and the US July non-farm employment data was significantly lower than market expectations. We believe that investors are actually worried about the prospects for US and global economic growth, including the current US inflation level is still far from the monetary policy target, the situation of the US election in the second half of the year is unclear, the size of the US Treasury is at a high level, and the global uncertainty is high.

"Why did exports exceed expectations again in August? Exports in August recorded 8.7% year-on-year, and the export growth rate hit a new high this year against the backdrop of a rebound in last year\'s base. Although there have been marginal disturbances in global economic demand recently, it has not yet affected the booming performance of exports, and exports from South Korea and Vietnam have also maintained a relatively high growth rate. Among them, on the one hand, it is strongly driven by emerging market demand, and on the other hand, it benefits from the booming performance of high-end manufacturing such as consumer electronics and mechanical transportation equipment. However, the performance of imports is """"not as expected"""".

Among them, exports to the United States were 4.9% year-on-year, a significant decline from the previous value, which may reflect the slowdown in the US economic growth rate, but exports to the EU, South Korea and Japan have rebounded year-on-year, at 13.4%, 3.4% and 0.5% respectively.",,neutral,,

"Among the post-cycle real estate products, only home appliances grew by 12% year-on-year, which may have benefited from the increase in summer demand, while furniture (-4.5% year-on-year) and lamps and lighting fixtures (-7.6% year-on-year) performed poorly, which may reflect that the current recovery of the US real estate market is still relatively slow.",,neutral,,
"The export performance of most labor-intensive products was relatively poor, among which the year-on-year growth rates of textile yarn, clothing, footwear, toys, and luggage were 4.5%, -2.7%, -5.5%, -8.3%, and -10.6%, respectively, which has a certain drag on my country\'s exports. This also reflects to a certain extent that my country\'s exports are gradually transforming towards high-end manufacturing, and the labor-intensive product market is gradually being replaced by low-cost countries such as ASEAN.",,neutral,,
"Looking ahead, as export fluctuations increase, the fourth quarter will be a key window for policy efforts. Since the beginning of this year, the excellent performance of exports has become an important driver of economic growth, effectively offsetting the lack of domestic demand against the backdrop of real estate adjustments and a slow fiscal pace. Entering the third quarter, the economic boom has slightly declined, and the policy window period has made sentiment and expectations slightly insufficient. However, we believe that the fourth quarter will be a key window for policy efforts, and the increase in external demand fluctuations may become an important trigger for policy games, which is mainly reflected in three aspects:",,neutral,,
"First, despite the strong performance of exports throughout the year, we still warn of the risk of a decline in external demand in the fourth quarter. With the global manufacturing PMI falling below the boom-bust line for two consecutive months, the global manufacturing recovery seems to have hit a """"bottleneck"""". In addition, as one of my country\'s most important trading partners, the US manufacturing boom has also continued to be sluggish, as evidenced by the poor performance of exports to the US in August. The US economy will continue to slow down in the future, and external demand may decline in the fourth quarter.",,negative,,
"Second, the base effect may increase the volatility of export growth. Since November last year, exports have accelerated their recovery and ended negative growth year-on-year. The base effect has greatly increased, which may increase the overall volatility of exports in the fourth quarter of this year.",,negative,,
"Third, beware of the adverse impact of increasing trade frictions on exports. The EU and US tariff sanctions on China have not yet ended, and Canada has recently proposed to impose large tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, steel and aluminum products after October. Trade frictions have intensified, which may have a significant impact on exports.",,negative,,
"Therefore, as the marginal impact of exports on the economy decreases, policy space will be further opened up. In the fourth quarter, policies such as lowering the reserve requirement ratio, lowering interest rates, lowering the interest rates of existing mortgage loans, and real estate storage may be introduced more quickly, and the fiscal side will gradually speed up to support the full-year economic growth target of 5%.",,positive,,

Looking forward, the high temperature weather continued in August, and vegetable prices may continue to rise. In terms of pork, the industry reduced the weight of shipments, supply increased, and the upward speed of pork prices slowed down.

We found that in the medium and long term, the upward momentum of travel and entertainment consumer prices is strong, which is an important support for the core CPI; in the short term, the core CPI in July turned from negative to positive month-on-month, and rose by 0.4 percentage points to +0.3% compared with the previous value, but it was still weaker than the seasonality. Among the sub-items that have been announced, cigarettes, clothing, household appliances, communication tools, tourism, communications and postal services were stronger than the seasonality on a month-on-month basis, and most other items were weaker than the seasonality on a month-on-month basis.",,neutral,,
"The month-on-month CPI of services has also been weaker than the seasonal performance for three consecutive months. The price performance of sub-items shows that the demand for most service consumption, except tourism, has slowed down. The key to reversing the trend may be to increase residents' income level and enhance residents' consumption confidence. The Political Bureau meeting in July 2024 pointed out that it is necessary to expand domestic demand with the focus on boosting consumption, increase residents' income through multiple channels, enhance the consumption capacity and willingness of low- and middle-income groups, take service consumption as an important starting point for consumption expansion and upgrading, and support cultural tourism, elderly care, childcare, housekeeping and other consumption.

"Core point of view: The super-seasonal decline in PMI in October shows that the foundation for the current economic recovery is still unstable, but corporate expectations are still relatively optimistic.

With the implementation of additional issuance of government bonds and deficit adjustment, fundamentals will improve in the next six months. It is expected to maintain a high level of prosperity. Specifically, the production and demand index fell back in October, and the significant slowdown in production expansion was the main reason for the PMI\'s fall; the small business orders index rose against the trend, reflecting the transfer of policy-boosted demand; the price index was affected by commodity price fluctuations Falling sharply, inflation may have downward risks in October; inventories have reached a substantial turning point. Looking forward, with the additional issuance of treasury bonds and special bond quotas issued in advance, the PMI is expected to return above the boom and bust line in November and December; in the first quarter of next year, the additional issuance of treasury bonds and the early issuance of special bonds will gradually form a physical workload, and the fundamentals will further Improvement, economic growth is expected to have a """"good start"""".",,positive,,
"Production demand: The super-seasonal decline in manufacturing PMI highlights the policy-driven characteristics of economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI in October was 49.5%, a super-seasonal drop of 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, and returned to the contraction range again. The production index and new orders index were 50.9% and 49.5% respectively, down 1.8 and 1.0 percentage points respectively from the previous month. The level of manufacturing production and demand has declined seasonally. The super-seasonal decline of the PMI in October was mainly due to the larger month-on-month decline in the production index. Although there are factors such as fewer working days in October than in September and the acceleration of production in advance to cope with holiday consumer demand, the super-seasonal decline in the production index, The new orders index fell back to the contraction range, which may jointly point to the endogenous dynamism of economic recovery is not yet stable. The current round of economic recovery since August has obvious """"policy-driven"""" characteristics. The increase in demand may be mainly affected by policy support. Real demand It is not strong enough, so the seasonal decline in October is larger than in previous years. Looking further, the new export orders index in October was 46.8%, down 1 percentage point from the previous month and still in the contraction range. Although the single-month decline in exports from August to September continued to narrow, it may be mainly affected by the lower base, and external demand is still difficult to There is a definite improvement; the orders on hand index in October was 44.2%, down 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the PMI domestic and foreign demand index both fell in October.

"Core point of view: Social finance recorded negative growth in a single month for the first time since October 2005. The growth rate of M1 turned negative and M2 also fell to a historical low. There are obvious deviations and deviations from PMI, import and export, and high-frequency data since April. Although domestic demand is still insufficient, it is not as bad as financial data seems to reflect. In the short and medium term, the impact of """"squeezing water"""" will have a certain degree of sustainability, and financial data need to be viewed more rationally during the year. However, the fall in money growth further highlights the need to adjust interest rates. Follow-up attention will be paid to the effect of the new round of real estate purchase restriction policies and whether there will be further incremental policies; another point is the pace of fiscal efforts. Judging from the previous statements of the National Development and Reform Commission and the formulation of the Politburo meeting, after project screening The pace of government bond issuance may accelerate, and supporting reserve requirement ratio cuts may be imminent. In addition, in the longer term, it may be necessary to downplay the growth rate of total credit in the future to match the """"relationship between credit growth and high-quality economic development"""" pointed out in the first quarter monetary policy implementation report, and put more emphasis on the efficiency of meeting effective financing needs. .",,neutral,,

Looking forward, the inflated portion of deposit and loan momentum may be reduced, or mainly reflected in increments. This impact will last at least until the end of this year from a year-on-year perspective. 2) Rectification of manual interest reimbursement. In the past, manual interest payments were used to attract deposits at high interest rates, which may lead to the phenomenon of low loans and high deposits, or cause idling of funds to a certain extent, which is also not conducive to the transmission of the effects of deposit interest rate cuts. The increment of deposit and loan violations in the previous period may be corrected, which may disturb financial data in recent months from a month-on-month perspective.",,neutral,,

"3) Non-standard financing decreased slightly beyond seasonality. Over the years, non-standard financing has tended to show a seasonal decrease in April, but the net decrease of 448.6 billion yuan was super-seasonal.

"Recently, the price of gold has risen sharply and has continuously reached record highs. Central bank gold purchases and demand from individual investors in Asia may be important driving factors. How to track “real” central bank gold purchase data to help determine gold price trends? The analysis in this article is for reference.",,neutral,,
Hot thoughts: Who is the “marginal pricer” of gold?,,neutral,,
"Question: What is the pricing framework for gold now? The investment demand of the central bank and the private sector has jointly become the """"marginal pricing factor"""" of gold.",,neutral,,
"The supply of gold is almost rigid. High proportion and high volatility of private investment and central bank demand are the """"marginal pricing factors"""" of gold. Since 2002, the proportion of gold jewelry and industrial demand has declined significantly, replaced by more flexible private investment demand. The investment demand represented by gold ETF holdings was once highly correlated with gold price trends. In the past two years, with the significant increase in central bank gold purchases, the two types of """"highly volatile"""" demand from the central bank and the private sector have jointly become the """"marginal pricing factors"""" of gold. Under a simplified framework, investment demand that takes into account real interest rates determines the traditional center of gold prices; in the past two years, the demand curve caused by central bank gold purchases has shifted outward, causing the """"real interest rate"""" to deviate from the gold price. From 2010 to 2022, the central bank\'s annual gold purchase averaged 473 tons, which was relatively stable. Investment demand focusing on inflation, opportunity costs, etc. dominated the formation of gold prices, which was basically in line with the framework of real interest rates. Since 2022, the central bank\'s gold purchases have increased by an average of 587 tons per year, causing the central gap between gold prices and real interest rates to widen.",,neutral,,
"Second question: How to track gold purchases by the “central bank”? Pay attention to the gold export situation of Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and the speed of reduction of U.S. debt holdings in various countries.",,neutral,,
"In the past two years, the average annual scale of gold purchases by the central bank has increased from 473 tons in the previous 10 years to 1,059 tons; however, the monthly central bank declaration data is """"relatively lagging."""" The World Gold Council\'s quarterly central bank gold purchase data is calculated by cross-checking central bank declared values, confidential unrecorded buying and selling data and import and export trade flows, and may be relatively accurate. Several divergences in history may be due to the """"lag declaration"""" of some emerging market central banks. Since 2022, actual gold purchases and reported gold purchases have once again diverged significantly. This means that we cannot simply track the """"reported gold purchases"""" of various countries; the """"import and export"""" and """"U.S. debt sales"""" data provide an auxiliary verification perspective. First, the central bank usually purchases gold spot, and gold spot trading is concentrated in the London and Zurich markets, which can track the exports of the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Second, the scale of U.S. debt holdings may be able to """"gain a glimpse"""" of the pace of """"de-dollarization"""" in various countries, and then estimate the scale of gold holdings. Russia and Turkey are typical """"cases.""""",,neutral,,
"Question 3: What is the possible interpretation of gold prices in the future? There may be twists and turns in the short term, but with the support of central bank gold purchases, it is still expected to hit a new high in the medium term.",,positive,,
"Gold prices have surged recently, and central bank gold purchases and demand from Asian individual investors may be important driving factors. On the one hand, dismantling the time-sharing data on gold prices shows that since February 14, gold prices have surged mostly during the European independent trading hours; while the total gold exports of Switzerland and the United Kingdom in January reached US$23.4 billion, a record high. On the other hand, judging from gold ETF flows, the enthusiasm of European and American investors has waned, but Asian investors are still accelerating their purchases, which is also reflected in the gold premium in the Chinese and Indian markets. In the medium term, central bank gold purchases may still support gold prices to reach new highs. On the one hand, """"de-dollarization"""" is not a global behavior that is easy to repeat, or a """"decoupling"""" of some countries. Considering the current low proportion of gold reserves in such countries, as the price of U.S. debt rebounds, the pace of central bank gold purchases Easy to rise but difficult to fall.

After the normal throughput of treasury bonds, the net purchase volume throughout the year may not be less than a single RRR cut of 25BP, corresponding to the release of more than 500 billion yuan in base currency, and will gradually replace foreign exchange reserves as the central bank\'s main asset. As """"retirement national debt"""" increases, fiscal interest payment pressure will also be eased. Once again, the price signal is neutral. Under normal circumstances, government bond throughput only serves as the main body of liquidity injection, while interest rate management will mostly follow the existing paradigm and be guided by tools such as reverse repurchase. Of course, under special circumstances, the central bank cannot rule out the potential function of """"yield curve management"""".",,neutral,,
"Second, the frequency and scale of operations are relatively limited, and the impact on market supply and demand is relatively controllable. In the """"starting period"""", the core task of the central bank is to solve the problem of """"have or not"""". Therefore, a """"small steps and fast running"""" strategy may be adopted, and the trading frequency may be significantly higher than the RRR cut, ranging between 1-2 times per month, eventually forming a weekly or bi-weekly normalized operation mode. Based on the aforementioned estimated annual investment volume, the central bank’s monthly net purchases are approximately RMB 40-50 billion, which has a controllable impact on the overall supply and demand of the market.",,neutral,,
"Third, the allocation structure is expected to follow the """"neutral principle"""" to reduce distortion of the interest rate curve. The structural characteristics of my country\'s national debt are quite different from those of the United States. The maturity distribution is generally """"right-skewed"""" and the proportion of long-term national debt is relatively high. If the central bank follows the """"neutral principle"""" and allocates debt according to the structure of existing government bonds, the impact on the interest rate curve will be more balanced.

"Looking forward to the overseas macroeconomics in 2024, we describe it as a year in which risks of downward economic momentum and opportunities for cycle switching coexist. The real GDP of the United States first fell on a quarter-on-quarter basis and then rebounded.

In 2023, industrial output, operating income and profit margins will decline, but the job market remains strong, and private consumption, especially service consumption, remains resilient. In 2024, the main lagging indicators such as employment, core inflation and service consumption will decline, but industrial output , operating income, profit margins and private inventories may take the lead in bottoming out and returning to expansion, and various economic sectors will """"stagger down"""".

Although the non-agricultural sector Indicators of payrolls and jobless claims suggest the job market remains strong, but rising unemployment and falling job openings reflect cracks forming, and polls show two-thirds of middle-class Americans face financial hardship. Inflation in the United States remains highly sticky, and non-farm employment has exceeded expectations, once again restricting the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, and market institutions have once again postponed expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. In addition, considering the short-term increase in shipping freight prices and the extension of the OPEC-production reduction plan, short-term U.S. inflation is still likely to recur. Against this background, high interest rates, high inflation, and structural contradictions in the United States have become more prominent, and the risk of a """"hard landing"""" for the U.S. economy has increased. Amid expectations of falling inflation and interest rate cuts, the Eurozone economy is gradually recovering; Japan\'s economy is recovering steadily, service industry prosperity remains high, and nominal wage growth has reached a new high since October 1994.

In terms of budget completion, the general fiscal expenditure budget completion in March was 8.1%, lower than the 9.1% in the same period in 2023, and the government fund expenditure budget completion was only 5.5%, significantly lower than the 7.3% in the same period in 2023. Looking forward, the fiscal """"surplus"""" will increase significantly, and most of the trillions of national debt will be issued at the end of 2023 or early 2024, which may effectively support the subsequent intensification of broad fiscal expenditures. The slow issuance of new special bonds in the first quarter may be a short-term disturbance. In the first quarter of 2024, a total of 634.1 billion yuan of new local special bond issuance was issued, which was lower than the 1.36 trillion yuan of new local special bond issuance in the first quarter of 2023; the progress of new local special bond issuance in the first quarter was only 16%, lagging behind the same period in 2023 About 19 percentage points. In mid-April, the National Development and Reform Commission stated that the screening of special bond projects has been completed. From May, the new local special bonds may be accelerated to support the subsequent increase in government fund expenditures. Whether land transfer revenue can stabilize may constrain the intensity of broad fiscal spending for a long time. The 2024 government fund revenue growth target is set at 0.1%, but local state-owned land transfer revenue continued to decline in the first quarter, falling 21% year-on-year in March. According to the calculation of the proportion of land transfer revenue in 2023, if the fiscal revenue from state-owned land drops by 10%, the corresponding growth rate of general fiscal expenditure will drop by nearly 2%. Whether subsequent land transfer revenue can stabilize may be one of the important factors affecting the intensity of broad fiscal expenditures. Reiterate the view: Broad fiscal expenditures dropped significantly in March, mainly due to the slow progress of special bond issuance and the drag on land transfer revenue. The slow issuance of special bonds may be a short-term disturbance. The National Development and Reform Commission has completed screening of special bond projects in mid-April. The new local special bonds may be accelerated in May, thereby supporting the increase in government fund expenditures.

Looking forward, the aspect with relatively strong certainty is the acceleration of special bond issuance and the upward trend in infrastructure investment due to the continued issuance of ultra-long-term special government bonds. The aspect with relatively strong uncertainty is the recovery process of the real estate industry. The new round of growth-stabilizing policies that may be launched at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in July is worth looking forward to.",,neutral,,
"(1) Social consumption rebounded year-on-year in May, but the cumulative consumption in the first five months was still relatively low year-on-year.",,neutral,,
"In May 2024, social zero sales rebounded year-on-year and month-on-month. Social zero sales recorded a year-on-year +3.7%, +1.4 PCTS compared with April, and social zero sales +0.51% month-on-month, +0.45 PCTS compared with April. We believe that the rebound in consumption in May compared with April was partly due to the fact that the number of working days in May was reduced compared with April, and residents had more time for consumption. This can be reversely confirmed by the downward trend of the PMI production index in May compared with April. At the same time, it is worth noting that from an absolute level, the current consumption level is still not high. First of all, compared with the month-on-month retail sales ratio in May from 2012 to 2019 before the epidemic, May this year ranked second from the bottom, indicating that the current retail sales ratio is weaker than seasonal. Secondly, the social retail sales in the first five months of this year, which are not affected by single-month fluctuations, recorded a year-on-year +4.1%. In fact, it is still significantly lower than the pre-epidemic center, indicating that household consumption still needs to be further repaired. Overall, consumption in May has recovered compared with April, but looking beyond single-month fluctuations, the current consumption center is still at a relatively low level. We believe that the continued low level of consumption is the combined impact of the slowdown in residents\' income growth, the shrinkage of residents\' wealth amid the downturn in the commercial housing market, and the slowdown in balance sheet expansion. As a relatively late-cycle component of the economy, the subsequent substantial rise in the household consumption center depends on the recovery process of my country\'s overall economy after the stabilizing growth policy takes effect.",,negative,,

Looking at the three core sub-items of fixed investment, in May this year, manufacturing investment +9.4%, infrastructure investment +3.78%, and real estate investment -11.0%. Manufacturing investment is the main driver of fixed investment, and real estate investment is still the main driver of fixed investment. the main drag term.",,neutral,,
Manufacturing investment continued to maintain high growth rate in May,,positive,,
"In May 2024, manufacturing investment recorded +9.4%, slightly lower than in April, but still the highest growth rate in the past 60 months (ranked 12th in the past 60 months). The growth rate of manufacturing investment has been at a high level since the beginning of this year, mainly due to: since the end of last year, the inventory of industrial finished products has continued to rise year-on-year, and a new round of inventory replenishment has begun; with the dual efforts of policy support and industrial development progress, high Technology industry investment plays a greater role in driving investment in the entire manufacturing industry. Investment in high-tech manufacturing in the first five months recorded +10.4%, which is significantly higher than the overall cumulative growth rate of manufacturing investment. Since the beginning of the year, exports have continued to exceed expectations, and investment in the export industry chain has also promoted overall manufacturing investment. The cumulative export growth rate (in US dollars) in the first five months of this year was +2.7%, while the cumulative export growth rate in the same period last year was negative. Overall, with the support of multiple favorable factors such as the recovery of domestic and foreign demand, policy support to support equipment renewal, and an upward inventory cycle, it is expected that subsequent manufacturing investment will remain resilient.",,positive,,
Real estate investment saw limited improvement in May,,negative,,
"In May 2024, the growth rate of real estate investment was -10.0%, a slight increase of 0.5 PCTS from the decline in April. In May, investment in residential buildings, office buildings and commercial buildings were -10.9%, -18.3% and -13.2% respectively year-on-year. The decline in residential investment, which accounted for the largest proportion, deepened. Overall, real estate-related data in May could not be said to have improved. First-hand commercial housing sales, real estate investment and real estate development funding sources continued to record relatively large declines. The relative bright spot was that the year-on-year decline in domestic loans to real estate companies changed from last month to this month. The increase of nearly 20% reflects that under the policy of stabilizing real estate, banks have increased their support for real estate companies. From an inventory perspective, according to our statistics, commercial housing inventory continued to decline in May. As of May, my country\'s commercial housing inventory was 2.348 billion square meters, and the commercial housing destocking cycle was 33.2 months. It continued to rise from April and is still in May 2021. The continuous upward trend of the commercial housing inventory cycle shows that the entire real estate industry is still trapped by the low willingness of residents to purchase houses, and it continues to be in a state of rising inventory while the destocking cycle is still rising. The policies to stabilize commercial housing sales that were introduced in May are expected to be implemented in June and July. Whether subsequent commercial housing sales and real estate investment data can improve remains to be seen.",,negative,,
"The growth rate of infrastructure investment in May was lower than that in April, and there is a high probability of an upward trend in the future.",,positive,,
"In May this year, infrastructure investment increased by 3.8% year-on-year, compared with -2.1 PCTS in April, ranking 43rd in terms of monthly year-on-year growth in the past 60 months. The growth rate is not high (2021 is a two-year compound growth rate). According to cumulative data, the growth rate of infrastructure investment in the first five months of this year was +6.7%, down 1.1 PCTS from the previous four months, ranking 28th in terms of monthly year-on-year growth in the past 60 months, and the growth rate was in the middle. The growth rate of infrastructure construction in May was not high, mainly due to the slow issuance of special bonds this year, which dragged down the advancement of infrastructure projects. It is worth noting that new special bond issuance nationwide in May was 438.3 billion yuan, a significant increase from 88.3 billion yuan in April. It was also the highest single-month special bond issuance amount since the beginning of the year. In the first five months of this year, special bond issuance completed 31.4% of the annual target, and the completion progress is still significantly behind the 49.9% in the same period in 2023 and 55.7% in the same period in 2022. As subsequent special bond issuance continues to accelerate, the financial support for infrastructure investment will rise significantly, and by then the growth rate of infrastructure investment is expected to be higher than the current rate. Overall, with the support of projects such as the """"Three Major Projects"""", infrastructure construction is expected to remain strong throughout the year and is expected to achieve a growth rate of more than 7.0%.",,positive,,
(3) Industrial production growth slowed down in May,,negative,,
"In May 2024, the added value of industries above designated size was +5.6% year-on-year, slightly lower than market expectations (+5.96%), and down 1.1 PCTS from April. From January to May 2024, the cumulative added value of industrial enterprises above designated size increased by 6.2% year-on-year, a decrease of 0.1 PCTS compared with the same period last year. Divided into three categories, the added value of the mining industry for the month was +3.6% year-on-year, the manufacturing industry was +6.0%, and the public utilities were +4.3% year-on-year. The recovery slope of industrial production in May was slower than that in April. From the perspective of sub-sectors, among the 17 sub-sectors that have announced the growth rate of added value for the month, only 5 sub-sectors saw an upward growth in value-added year-on-year compared with April, while the remaining 12 sub-sectors all fell back to varying degrees. The performance of industrial production corresponds to the recent trend of unilateral overseas tariff increases and the acceleration of anti-globalization. Sub-sectors that are highly dependent on external demand performed weakly. The performance of China\'s new energy vehicle manufacturing and other fields has fallen from its high point due to industrial transfer and contraction. . Looking forward, the PMI\'s new export orders index dropped significantly in May, and the export momentum\'s support for the economy faces increasing uncertainty. First, political factors such as overseas situations and the U.S. election are increasingly disrupting trade. Secondly, as the world\'s largest consumer country, the United States has seen weakening economic data since April, including CPI, retail sales, and ISM manufacturing PMI, which may indicate that U.S. economic activity is showing signs of cooling down under the suppression of high interest rates for two years. It may drive down external demand. In terms of domestic demand, the endogenous driving force of my country\'s economy is currently still weak, and real estate is still in a downward trend; however, equipment updates and technological transformation and upgrading are expected to provide certain support for domestic demand, and the effects of stabilizing growth policies are worth looking forward to.",,negative,,

"Personal consumption is the """"stabilizer"""" of the U.S. economy in 2023 and is also the core contradiction of the U.S. economy in 2024. The report explains the resilience of personal consumption in 2023 from four aspects: employment, savings, finance and distribution, and then looks forward to the prospects of U.S. consumption in 2024. The conclusion is that the support of the four factors on consumption is weakening and will even become opposite.",,,,
Hot Thoughts: 4 Explanations for U.S. Consumption Resilience,,,,
"The performance of the U.S. economy in 2023 will continue to exceed expectations, and personal consumption plays a major role. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) account for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP (service consumption accounts for 65% of PCE). Therefore, it can be said to a certain extent that PCE dominates the direction of GDP. In the first three quarters of 2023, the real GDP growth rate (annualized) of the United States was 2.2%, 2.1% and 4.9% respectively, the PCE growth rate was 3.8%, 0.8% and 4.0% respectively, and the pull rate was 2.5%, 0.6% and 2.7% , an average of 1.9%.",,,,
"To sum up, there are four main explanations for the resilience of U.S. personal consumption: First, the continued tightness of the labor market supports higher wage growth and personal income growth, which is the """"first driving force"""" for U.S. consumption to remain strong. . As of October 2023, the overall U.S. labor market remains tight. Empirically, the correlation coefficient between the Labor Market Conditions Index (LMCI) and the Atlanta Wage Growth Index is 0.75.",,,,
"Second, excess savings continue to decline and the marginal propensity to consume remains high. During the epidemic, the U.S. household sector accumulated approximately 2.5 trillion in excess savings, and by the end of September 2023, the cumulative decline was approximately 1.6 trillion (a cumulative decrease of 500 billion from January to September 2023). In addition, since the beginning of 2022, the U.S. household savings rate (savings/disposable income) has been at a historically low level (about 4%, with an average of 7.6% from 2015 to 2019), which is equivalent to an increase in the average consumption propensity by 3.4 percentage points.",,,,
"Third, the """"procyclical"""" fiscal expansion, the decline in personal income tax, and the increase in social security expenditures have caused the growth rate of residents\' disposable income to be significantly higher than the income growth rate. In January 2023, the year-on-year growth rate of personal disposable income in the United States jumped to 9%. The average growth rate from January to September was 3 percentage points higher than the growth rate of personal income and 2 percentage points higher than the growth rate of personal consumption expenditures. Because the personal tax deduction for single or married people filing separately will increase to $13,850 in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 7%.",,,,
"Fourth, residents’ leverage ratio and interest rate sensitivity of liabilities are both at a low level. Interest expenses are a deduction from disposable income, but due to the continuous deleveraging of the residential sector since 2008 (down from 99% in early 2008 to 74%), residential mortgage loans on the liability side have longer maturities and are mainly fixed interest rates ( After 2008, the proportion was in the 90-95% range), and the asset side benefited from interest rate hikes, so the Fed\'s interest rate hikes did not significantly """"crowd out"""" consumption.",,,,
"However, the support of the above four factors has weakened to varying degrees: (1) the downward trend in wage growth continues, and the tightness of the job market may be weaker than the level indicated by the unemployment rate or job vacancies; (2) Excess savings are """"used up"""", and there is little room for further improvement in the average propensity to consume; (3) the increase in personal income tax deductions is a """"one-time""""; (4) residents\' pressure to pay interest is rising at the margin, among which the average Low-income groups with higher consumption propensity are under greater pressure.",,,,

"Event: On July 12, the central bank released financial data for June 2024. M2 in June was 6.2% year-on-year, and the previous value was 7.0%.

New social financing increased by 3.30 trillion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 928.3 billion yuan. The growth rate of social financing stock was 8.1%, compared with the previous value of 8.4%.",,,,
"Core point of view: Financial data improved seasonally on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but under the influence of the high base of the impulse effect at the end of last quarter, it further weakened year-on-year. The impact of short-term factors such as water squeeze, adjustments to the value-added assessment method of the financial industry, and the prevention of idling are also continued. Government bonds are still the main supporting factor. Corporate bonds are greatly affected by the high year-on-year base of urban investment bonds. The momentum has weakened after two consecutive months of bill financing. Residential and corporate loans both reflect insufficient physical demand. Looking forward, one is to pay attention to the speed of fiscal investment (on July 10, the National Development and Reform Commission stated that last year’s trillion-dollar additional government bond issuance project has completed investment of 480 billion yuan); the other is that as the Fed’s interest rate cut expectations increase, the pressure to stabilize the exchange rate may weaken, and attention will be paid to the domestic three or four Possibility of quarterly rate cut.",,,,

However, compared with the net financing of 151.665 billion yuan in the same period last year, the year-on-year decrease was relatively large, which may be a drag on the social financing caliber.

"On-balance sheet loans are still the main reason for dragging down social finance. In other sub-items, off-balance sheet loans are still the biggest drag, with a year-on-year decrease of 1.05 trillion yuan. The fluctuations in non-standard financing mainly came from the year-on-year decrease in undiscounted bank acceptance bills (-135.6 billion yuan) and the year-on-year increase in trust loans (+90.2 billion yuan).",,,,
"Loans surged seasonally, and it is difficult to change the year-on-year weakness. From the perspective of loan structure, the support for bill financing, which has surged for two consecutive months, has further weakened. It decreased by 39.3 billion yuan that month and 42.8 billion yuan less than the same period last year. It is the only positive contributor to on-balance sheet credit. There is a certain seasonal rebound in corporate and household loans, which is reflected in the month-on-month improvement, but year-on-year is still significantly weaker than the same period last year. Among them, corporate medium- and long-term loans significantly decreased by 623.3 billion yuan year-on-year. The main reason was insufficient corporate financing demand itself, but it was superimposed on the continued impact of """"squeezing water"""" and the impact of a high base. Regarding residents, whether it is short-term or long-term loans, consumption and home purchase demand still need to improve. At the same time, the phenomenon of early repayment of loans may still exist, and residents\' willingness to increase leverage is still low. Although real estate sales improved month-on-month in June, the phenomenon of second-hand housing exchanging price for volume still exists. The stabilization of real estate sales may still require further policy support.",,,,
"From a historical perspective, the drag on household loans may be greater. From a year-on-year perspective, the drag on the corporate sector may be greater in June, but compared with the same period in history, new corporate loans in June and the second quarter were lower than the same period in 2022 and 2023, but higher than the same period before 2022; Loans to the residential sector are weaker than the same period during 2016-2023. Since the leverage ratio of the corporate sector will increase significantly in 2022 and 2023, with a total increase of 14.3 percentage points in the two years, new loans to the corporate sector will increase by 17.1 and 17.9 trillion yuan respectively in 2022 and 2023. The two-year compound growth rate was 22%, while the compound growth rate in the previous ten years was only 10%.",,,,
"The growth rates of M2 and M1 further declined. The net increment of M1 has been significantly weaker than the seasonality for three consecutive months. The impact of deposit relocation under the influence of manual interest payments continues, fiscal investment is still slow, and the vitality of the real economy needs to be improved. The decline in M2 growth may still be mainly affected by the decline in credit and the reduction in deposits.

"Regarding the classification of the term structure of external debt. There are two classification methods for classifying foreign debt according to its term structure. First, it is divided according to the contract period, that is, foreign debts with a contract period of more than one year are medium- and long-term foreign debts, and foreign debts with a contract period of one year or less are short-term foreign debts; second, they are divided according to the remaining period, that is, based on the contract period.

This press release divides medium- and long-term external debt and short-term external debt according to the contract period.",,,,
"Trade-related credit is a broader concept. In addition to trade credit and advances, it also includes other credits provided for trading activities. By definition, trade-related credit includes trade credit and advances, bank trade financing, trade-related short-term notes, etc. Among them, trade credit and advance payment refer to external liabilities arising from the direct provision of credit between the seller and buyer of goods transactions between residents of mainland China and non-residents abroad (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), that is, due to the commodity A debt is formed when the time of payment of funds is different from the time when ownership of the goods is transferred. Specifically, it includes suppliers (such as overseas exporters) directly providing credit for goods transactions and services, and buyers (such as overseas importers) paying in advance for goods and services and work in progress (or preparing to undertake); bank trade financing refers to A trade-related loan provided by a third party (such as a bank) to an exporter or importer, such as a loan provided by a foreign financial institution or export credit agency to a buyer.",,,,

"Abstract: Since late December, global demand has hovered at a low level, and the Red Sea crisis has disrupted global energy transportation. Credit in the United States has expanded. Although the manufacturing industry has contracted more, the service industry has maintained expansion. Employment has strengthened again. Core inflation has cooled and slowed down. The overall U.S. economy has once again shown some resilience. Federal Reserve officials have expressed that they are in no rush to cut interest rates quickly. U.S. bond yields have increased significantly. The U.S. dollar also rebounded. The relative resilience of the U.S. economy is expected to continue in the short term, and the U.S. dollar may rise slightly in the short term. The Eurozone economy as a whole maintained a sharp contraction, with employment preferences and core inflation continuing to cool. The relative economic weakness drove the euro down against the US dollar. The short-term relative weakness of the Eurozone economy may increase, and the euro is expected to depreciate against the US dollar. Japan's economy further slowed down, and a strong earthquake hit economic expectations. At the same time, Japan's nominal wage growth fell sharply, inflation continued to cool, and the market lowered expectations of the Bank of Japan's easing and tightening. As a result, the Japanese yen fell sharply. Japan's economy will still tend to weaken in the short term, and the yen is expected to be weak against the US dollar. The momentum for domestic economic recovery has weakened, the interest rate gap between China and the United States has widened again, residents and companies are more willing to purchase foreign exchange, and the RMB has depreciated against the US dollar. Under the pressure of interest rate differentials, the RMB is expected to depreciate slightly against the US dollar in the short term.",,,,

"On July 5, the French Pension Reserve Fund (FRR) released its 2023 annual report. The annual investment return rate was 9.7%, and the latest asset size was 21.2 billion euros. In 2023, FRR will allocate a diversified asset portfolio, of which the investment return rate of the performance asset portfolio will be 13.3% and the investment return rate of the value-preserving asset portfolio will be 6.4%.",,,,
Peaceful perspective:,,,,
"In 2023, FRR will achieve an investment return rate of 9.7%. After excluding payments, the total asset size will decrease slightly. In 2023, the global economy will gradually recover from negative factors such as the epidemic, inflation will be significantly reduced, and various assets invested by FRR will have good return performance. The annual investment income amount was 2 billion euros, with a total investment rate of return of 9.7%. However, according to French government regulations, FRR still needs to pay 2.1 billion euros to the French Social Security Debt Management Fund (CADES) in 2023. As of the end of 2023, FRR's asset size is 21.2 billion euros, a slight decrease from 2022.",,,,
"From the perspective of investment management, FRR has implemented three important decisions in 2023: First, continue to increase its holdings of high-yield corporate bonds and increase the weight of the performance asset portfolio from 67.6% to 70.3%. As the pressure on fund payments gradually eases, the pressure on hedging portfolios to cover liabilities gradually decreases. The above adjustments continue the trend of increasing the proportion of performance portfolios in recent years. The good performance of high-yield corporate bonds in 2023 has also made an important contribution to the overall yield of the fund. contribute. Second, significantly reduce holdings of hedging stocks. In 2022, FRR will increase the weight of stocks covered by options by about 11%, trying to deal with market risks through hedging operations of hedging options. However, this operation did not have a substantial positive effect in 2022, so FRR will correct this in 2023 and reduce the weight of hedging stocks to more than 10%. Third, increase attention to sustainable investment. In 2023, FRR emphasized the importance of sustainable investment in asset management at staff and governance seminars, believing that creating sustainable value and contributing to the global issue of climate change is one of the important meanings of the fund's existence. And the company's carbon emissions will be taken into consideration when deciding whether to invest in it.",,,,
"From the perspective of investment returns, all types of FRR assets performed well. The investment return rate of the performance asset portfolio was 13.3%, the investment return rate of the value-preserving asset portfolio was 6.4%, and the overall return rate was 9.7%. Specifically, in terms of stocks, the stock returns of the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar, the euro zone, and emerging countries in 2023 are 30.3%, 22.9%, 19.2%, and 6.1% respectively; in terms of investment-grade corporate bonds, the returns of euro bonds and U.S. dollar bonds in 2023 The yields on high-yield corporate bonds are 8.1% and 4.8% respectively; in terms of high-yield corporate bonds, the yields on euro bonds, U.S. dollar bonds and emerging country bonds in 2023 are 11.3%, 10.5% and 8.2% respectively, and the overall performance is better than investment-grade corporate bonds.",,,,
"Generally speaking, in 2023, the double bullish trend of stocks and bonds in the European and American markets will bring about a substantial improvement in FRR investment returns. In its asset allocation, the proportion of high-yield performance asset portfolios continues to increase, indicating that the fund's overall risk appetite continues to rise; however, structurally, FRR uses high-yield bonds to replace some hedging stocks, which also reflects its overall investment risk control.",,,,
"Risk warning: 1) Overseas economies have entered a deep recession, dragging down global economic and financial market trends and affecting FRR risk appetite. 2) The aging of the population has worsened beyond expectations, leading to policy adjustments for FRR to pay funds to CADES. 3) Geopolitical conflicts worsen, affecting FRR’s overall investment strategy.",,,,

We focus on improving the closed-loop management of financial supervision business to promote fiscal reform and strengthen budgets. Management plays an active role.",,,,
"2. Focus on two key points, clarify the main direction of attack, and make precise efforts to promote development in order to serve the overall situation.",,,,
"On the one hand, it supports the establishment of scientific and technological innovation, serves the new situation of local economic development, and promotes the implementation of major decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. Focusing on the construction of Shanghai International Science and Technology Innovation Center, we regard serving the national science and technology innovation strategy as a growth point to improve the quality and efficiency of departmental budget supervision. For example, we should implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions on strengthening basic research, conduct surveys on Shanghai’s basic research situation, and help improve Relevant policies to promote development; actively support the establishment of scientific and technological innovations such as national laboratories and ministerial universities, and strengthen the budget preparation of new scientific research equipment, the transfer of major national scientific and technological infrastructure, the reform of scientific and technological enterprises, and the use of local science and technology development funds guided by the central government. Communication beforehand and guidance during the process can improve the performance of central fiscal funds and consolidate the basic strength of scientific research.",,,,
"On the other hand, we should adhere to a problem-oriented approach, actively promote special actions for budget execution supervision and financial accounting supervision, and expand the effectiveness of supervision. In accordance with the deployment requirements of the Ministry of Finance, a working group and a special work class were established to make budget execution supervision and special actions for financial and accounting supervision the highlight of the year\'s work. We adhered to a problem-oriented approach and worked hard on precise efforts to ensure that all tasks are implemented in place. First, it is carried out in coordination with the daily work of budget supervision, relying on various information systems such as budget management integration, combined with daily supervision work such as financial authorization payment monitoring, and adhering to the combination of online monitoring and offline supervision to improve supervision efficiency. The second is to increase the intensity of financial and accounting supervision, taking the verification of special actions for budget execution supervision as an opportunity to carry out on-site supervision of relevant units, and give full play to the role of financial and accounting supervision in """"diagnosing the pulse"""" and """"treating diseases"""". The third is to adhere to the combination of """"immediate reform"""" and """"long-term establishment"""", and promote problem investigation and system construction in an integrated manner. It not only attaches importance to problem rectification and accountability, but also focuses on drawing inferences from one case and establishing rules and regulations, and continuously promotes the unit to improve the scientific and standardized budget management. , The level of legalization.",,,,
"3. Pay close attention to the three breakthroughs, deepen the transformation of functions, and inject new momentum into better playing the role of budget supervision.",,,,
"The first is to seek breakthroughs in improving the level of supervision. Adhere to the supremacy of the people, further improve the political stance, enhance overall awareness, focus on solving key issues in fiscal reform and development, and hot and difficult issues that the masses have strongly expressed, promote the optimization of fiscal resource allocation, improve the performance of fiscal funds, and promote various policies to be more timely and accurate. Fair benefits to the people. The party secretary and director of the bureau led the team to go deep into the front line to solve urgent, difficult and anxious problems. Through research and research, they understood the actual difficulties existing in the central budget units in Shanghai, and actively communicated with relevant departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Finance to assist in solving the problems. Through the working group, we will track and urge relevant authorities to speed up the allocation and disbursement of central transfer payment funds on a daily basis to ensure that medical personnel in Shanghai receive temporary work subsidies for the transition period in full and in a timely manner.",,,,
"The second is to seek breakthroughs in innovative supervision methods. On the one hand, we will promote a grid-based supervision operation mechanism and transform the supervision of transfer payment funds from the previous point-and-line type to a grid-based one, such as implementing a three-year round plan and multi-pronged supervision of transfer payment funds in each district. Next, promote the budget supervision work to be divided and combined, and gathered and gathered, so as to grasp the key points without leaving any dead ends. On the other hand, survey-based supervision was used to tighten the """"clockwork"""" of rectification. Members of the bureau\'s party group led the team to conduct surveys, convey relevant arrangements for special actions, and put forward specific requirements for rectification of supervision issues related to central transfer payment projects. Relevant units started from the implementation The main responsibility is to pay close attention to the implementation of """"treating the disease"""", looking in the mirror and """"treating the disease before it occurs"""", strictly implement the rectification of regulatory issues, draw inferences from one example and achieve good results.",,,,
"The third is to seek breakthroughs in improving the regulatory mechanism. On the one hand, we will continue to improve the basic information database for budget supervision. For example, on the basis of the department budget supervision issue database and personnel information database over the years, we will add a new budget unit asset database to dynamically grasp the preparation, inventory, and disposal of budget unit assets, and promote financial resources. Coordination; establishing an internal control database of the central budget units in Shanghai, covering the complete internal control report contents and comprehensive evaluation and analysis results of 232 units, to further standardize the operation of the power of budget units. On the other hand, multi-dimensional collaborative efforts are being made to explore and build a platform for collaboration and exchange with local finance, science and technology, health, education and other competent departments.

The exports of South Korea and Vietnam still maintained double-digit growth. Secondly, the United States replenished its inventory further. In June, the total inventory of the United States increased by 2.1% year-on-year, which has risen for 7 consecutive months. According to the forecast of this year's cargo volume updated by the National Retail Federation (NRF) in August, the import volume for the whole year of 2024 will increase by 12.1% year-on-year. The peak of the cargo volume on the US line this year will occur in August, and the cargo volume in the fourth quarter will not fall sharply. Shipping giant Maersk also said on August 7 that many retailers and consumer brands' purchase orders are expected to be imported to the United States in the next month, and the import demand is still quite strong. One background is that as the threat of a strike at the East Coast Port of the United States on October 1 is approaching, some freight forwarders have plans to ship goods in advance. Second, the decline in the unit price of export commodities has led to an improvement in the competitiveness of commodities. Among the 17 categories whose unit prices are calculated according to the General Administration of Customs' Trade Statistics Express, 14 categories will see a decrease in unit prices in 2023. In the first seven months of this year, except for traditional Chinese medicines, integrated circuits and ships, the export unit prices of other commodities continued to decline year-on-year.",,,,
"Exports to Europe continued to rise, and exports to Asia remained resilient: Exports to Europe continued to accelerate, up 13.4% year-on-year (previous value 8%), partly due to concerns about escalating trade frictions caused by the EU's taxation of electric vehicles on China, and some manufacturers may have plans to stock up in advance. Exports to the United States grew by 4.9% (previous value 8.1%). Exports to ASEAN fell to 9% for three consecutive months (previous value 12.2%). Exports to Japan rebounded to 0.5% year-on-year (previous value -6%), and exports to South Korea rose to 3.4% year-on-year (previous value 0.8%). Exports to Hong Kong, China grew by 7.9% (previous value 12.7%), and the average growth rate in July and August was slightly higher than that in the second quarter.",,,,
"The export of automobiles and semiconductors maintained high growth, while the decline in labor-intensive products narrowed: (1) The export growth rate of mechanical and electrical products was 11.9% (previous value: 10%), the export growth rate of high-tech products was 9.1% (previous value: 11.5%), and the export growth rate of labor-intensive products was -1.7% (previous value: -2.4%); (2) The export growth rate of automobiles was 32.7% (previous value: 13.8%), and that of mobile phones was 17% (previous value: 5%), and the growth rate continued to rise; the export of integrated circuits was 18.2% (previous value: 27.7%), household appliances was 12% (previous value: 17.2%), and general machinery and equipment was 11.3% (previous value: 14.7%), and the growth rate slowed down slightly; (3) The growth rates of textiles were 4.5% (previous value: 3.5%), and plastics were 1.8% (previous value: 1.2%), and the growth rates of exports of other categories of goods were still negative.",,,,
"Restocking is hindered and tariffs are added, and exports may be under pressure: This round of US restocking has passed the bottom, and the recovery is still suppressed by high interest rates. As of June, US sales growth has rebounded from the bottom of -3.2% to around 2.2%, and inventory growth has also rebounded from 0% to 2.1%. Judging from the consumption characteristics of US residents, the previously advanced commodity consumption is still higher than the normal trend, which means that the US retail growth rate may remain low for a period of time even after the Fed cuts interest rates, corresponding to the possibility of pressure on US inventory and China's export growth.",,,,
"Tariff risks still exist, beware of the drag on exports. The current US election is tense. Judging from the two presidential candidates, Trump has said that he will impose tariffs of up to 60% to 100% on Chinese imports, and Harris may continue the Biden administration's attitude towards China. In order to win over voters and reduce dependence on China's supply chain, the probability of imposing tariffs again is not low. By comparing the export performance of goods with and without tariffs in different rounds of the last round of trade war, we estimate that if the United States imposes a 60% tariff, my country's export growth to the United States will drop by about 34%; assuming that the proportion of exports to the United States drops from the current 14% to 10%, the degree of drag on my country's overall export growth by a large increase in tariffs may be between 3.4-4.7%.",,,,
Risk warning: Risk of weakening external demand; risk of domestic economic downturn; risk of intensified trade frictions.,,,,
"The high base effect of upstream representative prices gradually fades away, which is conducive to policy guidance to bring the inflation environment closer to a milder normal state.",,,,
"Inflation will end smoothly in 2023, with the year-on-year increase in core CPI remaining the same as the previous month, the year-on-year decrease in food CPI converging, and energy prices having a weak positive impact on the year-on-year CPI increase.",,,,
"An important reason for the stable ending of inflation is that the high base effect of upstream representative commodity prices has gradually faded. Previously, the prices of representative upstream commodities such as pork and diesel reached recent highs in November 2022 and dropped significantly in December. In the next period of time, the inflation environment is expected to get rid of the impact of drastic changes in the previous base effect.",,,,
"The price of edible agricultural products in December drove the decline in food CPI prices to converge. The average wholesale price of pork from the Ministry of Agriculture dropped to around 20 yuan/kg, mainly consolidating. After getting rid of the high base effect, the year-on-year decline in pork prices narrowed significantly. However, as the pig population is still at a relatively high level in recent years and feed prices are stable but declining (by early January, the wholesale price of corn in large and medium-sized cities had dropped to around 2.6 yuan/kg), the motivation for a rebound in pork prices is very limited.",,,,
"The year-on-year decline in PPI in December converged slightly, continuing to ensure that the overall increase in non-food CPI remained stable. The rent-related CPI remained unchanged month-on-month, and the year-on-year increase expanded to 0.2%, continuing the stabilization trend, indicating that urban housing supply and demand may be in a relatively balanced state. Core CPI rose 0.1% month-on-month, and the year-on-year increase was the same as the previous month.",,,,
"Energy prices had a weak positive impact on CPI in December. Recently, international oil prices have been mainly volatile. Concerns about the """"landing"""" of the U.S. and European economies, as well as the increase in crude oil production in non-OPEC+ countries such as the United States, have changed the game situation in the crude oil market. In early January, Saudi Arabia lowered the price of petroleum products in Asia, North America and other places, which may reflect the adjustment of its competitive strategy from """"production reduction"""" to """"bidding"""", creating a new round of pressure on oil prices. However, at the same time, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are escalating and causing disturbances to energy prices from time to time, making it difficult for international oil prices to form a sustained downward trend.",,,,
"Taken together, starting from December 2023, domestic inflation will gradually get rid of the impact of drastic changes in the previous base effect, which will be conducive to policy guidance to gradually bring the inflation environment closer to a more moderate normal state.",,,,
"Risk warning: unexpected changes in the real economy at home and abroad; unexpected tightening of domestic policies; escalation of international geopolitical tensions, etc.",,,,
Performance of major asset classes,,,,
"Last week, the Shanghai Composite Index, CSI 300 and ChiNext Index closed up 1.2%, 1.3% and 0.1% respectively. The bond market was flat overall, and the yields of government bonds diverged. The yields of 1-year and 5-year government bonds continued to rise by 8 and 0.5bp, while the yield of 10-year government bonds closed down by 3.2bp. Overseas, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices closed up 1.1%, 2.0% and 1.2% respectively.",,,,
"A-share allocation strategy: continue to pay attention to the opportunities of the highly prosperous home appliance sector under the subsidy policy. In terms of home appliances, the pull elasticity of the old-for-new policy on home appliances has been highlighted, and the performance of home appliances in Q3 is relatively certain, and the trading time is expected to continue until the third quarter report stage in October. Base metals performed strongly last week under the catalysis of the Fed\'s interest rate cut and the decline in exchange inventories, but the absolute level of inventory is still at a high level in recent years. After the interest rate cut is realized, futures prices need more macro and industry data to judge the direction, but from the third quarter report, the prices of base metals and precious metals have increased significantly compared with the same period in 2023. The third quarter report is relatively certain, and the stock price performance is still expected to be relatively strong. In terms of innovative drugs, the US """"Biosafety Act"""" was not included in the Senate\'s Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act after the market on September 20. This week, the CXO sector is expected to usher in a short-term rebound opportunity. It is still reiterated that the absolute return difficulty increases in the stage of the center of gravity moving downward, and it is difficult for the sector to go out of the independent market. It is still the best strategy to reduce positions and wait for the policy to be clear before adding positions at the right time. As treasury yields continue to fall, we remain optimistic about the defensive value of the dividend sector in the medium and long term.",,,,
Macroeconomic and policy trends,,,,
"On September 18, the Federal Reserve announced that it would lower the target range of the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a level between 4.75% and 5.00%. The dot plot shows that the Fed expects to cut interest rates by another 50 basis points in 2024. At the press conference, Fed Chairman Powell said that there was nothing in the Fed\'s economic forecast summary that indicated that it was in a hurry to complete the rate cut. The data will drive monetary policy choices, and the rate cuts will be accelerated, slowed down or suspended as needed. On September 20, the RMB rose to 7.05 against the US dollar, the highest point since May 2023. Against the backdrop of the US interest rate cut, exporters who hoarded US dollars in the early stage began to settle foreign exchange. In August, the bank\'s foreign exchange settlement and sales surplus on behalf of customers was US$909 million, a sharp increase of 46.6 billion yuan from July, ending the deficit since July 2023. It is expected that the bank\'s foreign exchange settlement and sales surplus on behalf of customers will further expand in September. In August, public fiscal revenue fell by 2.6% year-on-year, the same as the previous value. Public fiscal expenditure increased by 1.5% year-on-year, a decrease of 1 percentage point from the previous value. The national government fund revenue has dropped by 21.1% year-on-year, a 2.6 percentage point increase. The broad fiscal revenue (public fiscal revenue plus national government fund revenue) has dropped by 6% year-on-year, and the decline has continued to expand since the beginning of 2024.",,,,

"Last week, the net injection of open market operations was 917.9 billion yuan; A-share holdings increased by 97 million yuan, and the previous value was a reduction of 530 million yuan. Since September, IPOs have raised 2.5 billion yuan (3.17 billion yuan last month), and fixed increases have raised 1.25 billion yuan (5.9 billion yuan last month); stock and hybrid funds have issued 2.67 billion shares (a total of 7.88 billion shares were issued last month).",,,,
Risk warning: The Fed’s overly strong expectations for rate cuts are subject to adjustment; economic improvement this year is weaker than seasonal; food prices rise beyond expectations; and real estate “Golden September and Silver October” are lower than expected.,,,,
"In 2023, the central bank will use more quantitative tools such as excessive MLF renewals, large-amount net injections of reverse repurchases, and a robust combination of RRR cuts. This is reflected in the fact that MLF has been oversubscribed for 15 consecutive months, with the balance rising to 7.29 trillion, setting new highs in a row. The average daily reverse repurchase volume remains at about 270 billion yuan. The RRR will be reduced twice throughout the year, each time by 25 BP.",,,,
"Entering 2024, the central bank\'s operation of quantitative tools broke the market\'s inertial thinking, and the operation combination became an unexpected reduction in reserve requirements + MLF shrinkage + a reduction in the number of reverse repurchases. In February, the reserve requirement ratio was lowered by 50 BP beyond expectations, breaking the pattern of 25 BP each time in the past two years. In terms of MLF sequels, the excess volume in February was only 1 billion yuan, and the signal of shrinkage by 94 billion yuan in March was even more obvious. In March, the average daily size of reverse repurchase returned to about 10 billion yuan after half a year.",,,,
Why does the central bank change its quantitative tool operating mix?,,,,
"As a result of the flattening operation of the policy interest rate curve, MLF interest rates are relatively high and demand from commercial banks is reduced. The dual goals of preventing idling and guiding entity financing costs downward have brought about the flattening operation of the policy interest rate curve. Anti-idling has made the reduction of short-term (7-day reverse repurchase) and medium-term (MLF) policy interest rates more stable, and the goal of guiding entity financing costs downward is achieved through the decline of the 5-year LPR. The steady reduction of MLF has kept the MLF interest rate at 2.5%, which is about 25 BP higher than the issuance rate of 1-year interbank certificates of deposit and about 20 BP higher than the 1-year Shibor. The relatively high price of MLF makes commercial banks less willing to supplement liquidity through it.",,,,
"The central bank’s intention to maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity has not changed, and the operational mix of quantitative tools has changed:",,,,
"This open market business transaction announcement is different from the past. It has changed from """"fully satisfying the needs of financial institutions"""" to """"fully satisfying"""". This proves that this MLF reduction operation is not an initiative by the central bank to shrink liquidity. Taking both internal and external considerations into account and making discretionary decisions means that the MLF interest rate cut may have to wait. This will make it impossible to efficiently replenish the liquidity of commercial banks through large-amount MLF renewals in the short term. The quantitative instrument operation combination may be changed to RRR reduction + MLF shrinkage + Reverse repurchase volume reduction + structural monetary policy tools.",,,,
"The intensity of RRR cuts will increase. Both the RRR cut and the excessive MLF injection can have the effect of supplementing the medium and long-term liquidity of commercial banks. The differences between the two are: 1. The RRR cut promotes the growth of M2 without changing the base currency, while the MLF increases the base money supply; 2. Reducing the required reserve ratio can save costs for commercial banks. The unexpected lower reserve requirement ratio in February has sent a signal. At the economic-themed press conference during the two sessions, the governor of the central bank emphasized that """"currently, the average deposit reserve ratio of the entire Chinese banking industry is 7%, and there is still room for lowering the required reserve ratio in the future."""" A clearer signal was released. The magnitude and frequency of RRR cuts are likely to increase in 2024.",,,,
"Structural monetary policy tools will play a more important role in accurately delivering liquidity. It is expected that structural monetary policy tools will play a more important role in currency injection in the future, which can not only provide liquidity to commercial banks, but also guide credit to increase support for major strategies, key areas and weak links, and directly reach the real economy. If the domestic economic recovery encounters resistance again or the Federal Reserve enters an interest rate cutting cycle, the MLF interest rate may be lowered again, and the quantitative tools may be adjusted accordingly.",,,,

"Core point of view: The non-agricultural data in October cooled down as expected but has not yet led to recession expectations, providing further data support for the Federal Reserve to continue suspending interest rate hikes. The """"weaker economy → tightening slowdown"""" trade has increased, and the US dollar liquidity pressure has ushered in a respite. Non-agricultural employment in October cooled down as expected due to the impact of strikes in the automobile industry and other industries. Considering that the absolute level of new non-agricultural employment is still considerable (more than 200,000 new jobs have been created in the past three months), the U.S. economy is likely to continue to grow in the next three quarters. Temporary soft landing trend. Looking forward, the upward risk for U.S. inflation lies in the fact that the super core inflation in the fourth quarter or the remaining stickiness will further hinder the downward trend of inflation, and the recent rebound in U.S. stocks and the sharp fall in U.S. bond interest rates have once again caused """"financial conditions to loosen→entity"""" Demand improves → inflation rises again"""" feedback; the downside risk is that the unemployment rate will rise further and trigger Sahm\'s Rule (when the average unemployment rate in the past three months is 0.5% higher than the lowest value in the past 12 months, the economy is judged to be in recession) The """"technical recession"""" transaction in the """"Technical Recession"""" transaction means that when the unemployment rate hits 4.0%, Sahm\'s Rule will confirm that the U.S. economy has entered a recession.

"Supply and demand structure: Both supply and demand are weak, the gap has narrowed slightly, hourly wages have weakened month-on-month due to information technology, and the unemployment rate has rebounded. The resident survey questionnaire CPS shows (Figure 2) that the non-institutional population increased by 214,000 in October, and the labor force increased by -201,000. Both the new population and the reduced labor force went to the non-labor force, resulting in an increase of 416,000 non-labor force in October. people, the labor force participation rate dropped from 62.8% to 62.7%. The number of employed people decreased by 348,000 in October, 201,000 from the reduction of the labor force, and 146,000 from the newly unemployed, causing the unemployment rate to rise from 3.8% to 3.9%, and the employment rate to fall from 60.4% to 60.2%. The recovery margin of the labor force participation rate in October slowed down. From a structural perspective, the labor force participation rate of 16-19 year olds soared from 36.5% to 37.9%, which may be related to the restart of student loans. The main employment group is 25-54 years old and the 55+ group. Participation rates have all fallen, and labor supply recovery has declined. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the current labor supply gap in the United States (compared to the pre-epidemic trend line) is still 2.16 million. From the perspective of the supply and demand gap, although the number of job vacancies in September still slightly exceeded expectations, the decrease in the number of employees has made the demand for labor services weaker than the supply. The supply and demand gap narrowed slightly from the previous value of 3.138 million to 3.047 million. Under the balance of supply and demand, hourly wages +0.2% month-on-month, expected +0.3%, the previous value was revised up from +0.2% to +0.3%, hourly wages +4.1% year-on-year, +4.0% expected, the previous value rose from +4.2% to + 4.3%. Hourly wages were lower than expected month-on-month, and hourly wages in the service industry fell below +0.3% for the first time since April. But at the same time, it should be noted that the hourly wages of production and non-management positions increased by 0.34% month-on-month, which continued to rebound from the previous value of +0.31%. From a structural perspective, the hourly wages of production and non-management positions were greatly affected by the month-on-month increase of information technology -1.23% (previous value +0.2% ) was dragged down by the cliff-like decline. In addition, most hourly wages in the service industry have widened to varying degrees month-on-month.",,,,
"Demand for labor services: Strikes in the automobile industry have dragged down manufacturing employment, and employment in the service industry has cooled significantly.

A number of policies and measures that hindered fair access of business entities, affected fair competition among business entities, and restricted the free flow of commodity factors have been effectively corrected.

Comprehensive upgrade of the fair competition review system,,,,
"Xu Xinjian introduced that the Regulations have comprehensively upgraded the fair competition review system, which is mainly reflected in four aspects:",,,,
"The scope of the review is more comprehensive. The previous scope of fair competition review mainly included administrative regulations, rules, normative documents, other policy documents and specific policy measures in the form of """"one case, one discussion"""". This time the """"Regulations"""" further expanded the scope of review based on the previous period, requiring administrative agencies and organizations authorized by laws and regulations to manage public affairs to also conduct fair competition reviews when drafting laws and local regulations.",,,,
"The review mechanism is more complete. The """"Regulations"""" clarify that the State Council has established a fair competition review and coordination mechanism, stipulates the responsibilities of relevant units such as market supervision departments of local people\'s governments at or above the county level, and establishes a review work mechanism with clear rights and responsibilities.

"Review standards are more optimized. The """"Regulations"""" adhere to a problem-oriented approach and further optimize the four types of review standards that hinder market access and exit, hinder the free flow of goods and factors, affect production and operation costs, and affect production and operation behaviors, making them more targeted and guiding.

"Supervision and guarantee are more powerful. A special chapter of the """"Regulations"""" stipulates supervision and safeguard measures, requiring market supervision departments to strengthen the supervision and safeguards of fair competition review work.

Establish a review standard system covering the entire life cycle of business entities and the entire business chain,,,,
Zhou Zhigao introduced that the purpose of establishing a fair competition review system in my country is to prevent the introduction of measures that eliminate or restrict competition and create a good environment for fair competition among all types of business entities.

"In terms of affecting production and operating costs, fair competition must be ensured. The """"Regulations"""" stipulate that without the basis of laws and administrative regulations or without the approval of the State Council, no tax preferences shall be granted to specific operators, selective and differentiated financial rewards or subsidies shall be implemented, and no specific operators may be granted in terms of factor acquisition, administrative charges, etc. The purpose of operator preferences is to prevent some operators from obtaining unfair competitive advantages by relying on certain special policies.",,,,

"(1) There are recurring risks of U.S. inflation in the short term, but the stickiness of inflation has weakened, and the path for the Federal Reserve to lower inflation may be smoother in the future. Based on the data-dependent pattern of inflation, the Fed may delay cutting interest rates.",,,,
"The structure of the core PCE in the United States has changed, and the stickiness of inflation has weakened. In February, the year-on-year growth rate of U.S. core PCE was unchanged from the previous value, but the relatively sticky core services (excluding energy) had a marginal effect on the year-on-year growth of core PCE, while the semi-sticky core commodities (excluding food and energy) had a marginal impact on the core PCE growth rate. PCE\'s year-on-year growth rate rebounded marginally, and the stickiness of core inflation has weakened.",,,,
"Looking backward, taking into account the difference in stickiness between core services (excluding energy) and core commodities (excluding food and energy), there is still room for short-term energy price increases, or it may push up the price of core commodities (excluding food and energy) to rise again, while Prices of highly sticky core services (excluding energy) may fall more slowly, which may in turn bring about the risk of a recurrence of inflation. Given that the stickiness of inflation has weakened, the Fed may have a smoother path to lowering inflation in the future. However, based on the data-dependent pattern of inflation, the short-term Fed interest rate cut may be delayed. Powell also reiterated on March 29 that he is """"in no rush to cut interest rates.""""",,,,
"It is worth noting that commodity prices have increased significantly recently, and it cannot be ruled out that expectations of interest rate cuts in Europe and the United States have been priced in. The realization of interest rate cut expectations in Europe and the United States may alleviate the rise in commodity prices to a certain extent. If short-term U.S. inflation is mainly driven by commodity prices, the Fed\'s interest rate cuts may not push up inflation. In addition, potential risks for U.S. commercial real estate are still there. At a time when U.S. residents’ savings rate is at a historically low level, a premature U.S. interest rate cut may lead to capital outflows from the U.S., which will intensify the tightening of U.S. financial conditions to a certain extent and impact the U.S. financial market. Risks that may give rise to potential risk exposures. Based on this perspective, the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later than the European Central Bank. Combined with the recent statements of ECB officials, the probability of the ECB cutting interest rates in June has increased. For example, ECB Executive Committee Member Panetta said that """"ECB officials seem to have reached an agreement to reverse the previous interest rate hike with June as the starting point.""""",,,,
"china\'s interest rate system mainly includes two chains: the deposit and loan interest rate system and the financial market interest rate system. The deposit and loan interest rate system uses banks as intermediaries, and banks match the supply and demand of funds indirectly; financial market interest rates are formed in direct transactions, and supply and demand match themselves. Between the two chains, the bank\'s FTP pricing mechanism establishes a price comparison relationship between loan interest rates and financial market interest rates.",,,,
"Deposit and loan interest rates have experienced a market-oriented reform process from administrative control to self-regulatory management. The market-oriented reform of deposit and loan interest rates has gone through three stages. In 2004, the central bank relaxed the upper limit of loan interest rates and the lower limit of deposit interest rates, entering the stage of """"loan control lower limit and deposit control upper limit""""; in 2013 and 2015, the central bank successively relaxed administrative control on interest rates. , instead of establishing a self-regulatory pricing mechanism for market interest rates and a centralized quotation and release mechanism for basic loan interest rates, self-regulatory management replaces administrative control; the establishment of the LPR reform in 2019 and the market-based adjustment mechanism for deposit interest rates in 2022 marks the market-oriented reform of the deposit and loan interest rate system Go deeper.",,,,
"The deposit interest rate reference system may be more realistic. After the establishment of the market-based adjustment mechanism for deposit interest rates, there will be a benchmark and a reference system for deposit interest rates. The deposit benchmark interest rate may no longer have practical significance in the future; the newly established reference system may be the basis for future changes in deposit interest rates, which is conducive to maintaining relative stability. The difference between the loan/bond yield-deposit interest rate, that is, the reasonable bank net interest margin is relatively stable.",,,,
"The LPR interest rate is not necessarily bound to the MLF interest rate. The LPR quotation method is formed by adding points to the open market operation (MLF) interest rate. The range of the points """"mainly depends on each bank\'s own capital cost, market supply and demand, risk premium and other factors."""" The LPR interest rate is closely related to the MLF interest rate, but it does not necessarily follow the MLF completely. As interest rates move, structural changes in the LPR pricing mechanism may cause the LPR to adjust independently of the MLF.",,,,
"The central bank’s open market operation interest rate is the policy anchor for financial market transaction pricing. At present, the open market business with policy interest rate attributes carried out by the central bank mainly includes reverse repurchase and MLF. The reverse repo interest rate and MLF interest rate are determined by the central bank. In the narrow sense, the central bank plus interest rate cut, that is, reverse repo and MLF plus interest rate cut, are purely monetary policy behavior. The reverse repurchase rate and the MLF interest rate are the policy anchors for the pricing of funds and financial assets respectively. In practice, they have become the pricing benchmarks for the funding interest rate and interbank certificate of deposit interest rate respectively.",,,,
"The yield to maturity of government bonds is the core link connecting the interest rate transmission system. Treasury bond yield to maturity is the pricing anchor of the bond market, affected by funding interest rates and interbank deposit interest rates; it is also compared with loan interest rates in FTP; in addition, the market-based adjustment mechanism for deposit interest rates requires that deposit interest rates refer to the maturity of 10-year Treasury bonds Yield and 1-year LPR interest rate, almost every link in the interest rate transmission system is connected to the Treasury bond maturity yield.",,,,
"Future deposit interest rate cuts may be a more effective way to drive down LPR than MLF interest rate cuts. Our calculations have found that a time deposit “interest rate cut” of the same magnitude has a greater effect on reducing banks’ liability-side costs than an MLF interest rate cut. When deposit interest rates have been lowered or are expected to be lowered in the short term, banks may be motivated to lower the markup on the basis of keeping the MLF interest rate unchanged, and promote LPR to achieve interest rate cuts.",,,,
"Rising pressure on net interest margins has led banks to expect a """"cut"""" in deposit rates, but MLF interest rate cuts are still necessary. Since 2022, the net interest margin of commercial banks has been declining, and the pressure on interest margins has led to the need for commercial banks to lower deposit interest rates to more effectively reduce liability-side costs. But this does not mean that MLF interest rate cuts cannot lead to LPR reductions. During the monetary policy easing cycle, it is still a very necessary option for the central bank to lower MLF interest rates and guide commercial banks to lower LPR quotations. Especially if the MLF interest rate reduction step length can be increased, it will bring To achieve a more obvious cost reduction effect on the liability side.",,,,
Risk warning: Domestic monetary policy changes are unexpected,,,,
"Overseas, the expansion rate of the U.S. manufacturing PMI in February exceeded that of the service industry for the first time in a year. Several consecutive months of improvement indicate that manufacturers are emerging from a long-term downturn, while the weakening of recent interest rate cut expectations has hit the outlook for the service industry. Inflation data in January exceeded expectations, and employment showed no sign of cooling. Minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting showed that officials were worried about the risk of cutting interest rates prematurely and agreed that interest rates had reached their peak. The specific time for the first interest rate cut was still unclear. We believe that under the baseline scenario, the interest rate cut cycle will begin in May-June, and we will pay attention to January PCE data in the near future.",,,,
"Domestically, the LPR was lowered in February without lowering the MLF, which was intended to stabilize real estate and protect the exchange rate. The 5-year LPR interest rate dropped to a record high, reflecting the weakness of the real estate demand side and the urgency and intensity of policy support. However, the current actual interest rate It is still on the high side, and the stimulating effect on real estate sales may be limited. It is expected that LPR will still have room for further decline in the future. A week after the Spring Festival, the stock market rebounded and bond yields fell, both driven mainly by the implementation of monetary easing and the pause in economic slowdown. At present, the domestic market's pricing of the deterioration of economic fundamentals has ended, and the subsequent market may game policy expectations and pay attention to the upcoming National Two Sessions in March.",,,,

"In June, my country\'s new social financing was 3.3 trillion (market expected 3.22 trillion), a year-on-year decrease of 928.3 billion; new RMB loans were 2.13 trillion (market expected 2.13 trillion), a year-on-year decrease of 920 billion; M2 increased by 6.2% year-on-year (Market expectation is 6.7%), M1 decreased by 5.0% year-on-year.",,,,
1. Credit: The total amount target continues to be diluted,,,,
"New credit continues to be weaker than seasonality, but after significant adjustments in the first two months, the impact of optimization of financial supply on financial aggregates has weakened. New RMB loans in June were RMB 2.13 trillion, lower than the average of about RMB 160 billion in the same period over the past five years. The decline (7%) was significantly narrower than the previous month (35%); however, RMB loans invested in the real economy were RMB 2.2 trillion. , lower than about 242 billion in the same period in the past five years, and the decline (10%) is still higher than the overall loan.",,,,
"On the corporate side, the surge in credit at the end of the quarter has significantly eased, and the steady increase in bill volume shows that credit data has basically reflected real demand. On the one hand, credit growth in June exceeded expectations last year as financial institutions """"compensated for price with volume"""", pushing up the base and resulting in a substantial year-on-year decrease this year. In June, non-financial corporate loans increased by 1.63 trillion yuan, a decrease of 650.3 billion yuan year-on-year. Among them, medium and long-term loans increased by 970 billion that month, a decrease of 623.3 billion year-on-year; short-term loans increased by 670 billion, a decrease of 74.9 billion year-on-year. On the other hand, the slow recovery of credit demand drives bill discounting, but the limited volume of bills coupled with stable interest rates shows that the seesaw effect of credit and bills has also weakened. Net financing of bills in June decreased by 39.3 billion, a decrease of 42.8 billion year-on-year, which was significantly narrowed from the previous month (a year-on-year increase of 315.2 billion in May); the central bank\'s half-year direct discount interest rate was 1.45%, an increase of 3bp month-on-month.",,,,
"On the residential side, although the effects of the new real estate 517 policy have appeared, the interest rate spread between existing and new mortgage loans has widened, and the pressure for early repayment still exists. Residential loans increased by 570.9 billion in June, still 393 billion less than the same period last year. Under the combined effect of the New Deal and the base effect, the year-on-year growth rate of commercial housing sales in large and medium-sized cities in June was -20%, 18pct narrower than in May. However, due to the impact of early repayment, medium and long-term loans increased by 320.2 billion, a decrease of 142.8 billion year-on-year. In addition, short-term loans increased by 247.1 billion, a decrease of 244.3 billion year-on-year.",,,,
2. Social Financing: Government Financing Forms Support,,,,
"In June, social financing increased by 3.3 trillion yuan, and the stock growth rate dropped by 0.3pct to 8.1%. From a structural point of view, due to the high base last year, RMB loans invested in the real economy are the main factor dragging down social financing; while the pace of fiscal financing is still relatively fast, government debt financing constitutes the main force supporting social financing, with an increase of 848.7 billion in June, year-on-year. An increase of 311.6 billion.",,,,
3. Currency: M2 downward trend expands again,,,,
"In June, the year-on-year growth rate of M2 continued to decline by 0.8pct to 6.2%, and the downward trend expanded again. On the corporate side, mainly due to the slowdown in loan derivation and the standardization of manual interest payments, corporate deposits increased by 1.0 trillion yuan in June, a sharp decrease of 1.1 trillion yuan year-on-year. On the resident side, in the environment of downward deposit interest rates, residents are still enthusiastic about the allocation of stable and low-volatility financial products. This is reflected in the fact that the return on financial statements at the end of the first half of this year was weaker than the same period in previous years. As a result, resident deposits increased by 2.1 trillion in June, which was less than the same period last year. An increase of 533.6 billion. On the government side, due to the rapid issuance of fiscal bonds and relatively slow spending, fiscal deposits decreased by 819.3 billion in June, a decrease of 230.3 billion year-on-year.",,,,
"Affected by slow fiscal expenditure, slowdown in corporate financing and increased allocation of financial management, M1 growth rate in June was -5.0% year-on-year, down 0.8pct month-on-month, setting another record low. On June 19, President Pan Gongsheng clearly pointed out at the Lujiazui Forum that “my country’s M1 statistical caliber was established 30 years ago. With the rapid development of financial innovations such as financial service facilitation, financial markets and mobile payments, it is in line with the money supply. In particular, the category of financial products defined by M1 statistics has undergone significant evolution, and it is necessary to consider dynamic improvement of the statistical caliber of money supply."""" In order to better reflect the true situation of money supply, future M1 statistics may include residents\' current deposits, currency-based and cash-based financial products, as well as reserves from third-party payment institutions and other financial instruments that can be used for direct payments.",,,,
4. Impact on the bond market: continued shock,,,,
"Since June, funds have remained reasonably abundant and A-shares have continued to fluctuate. Funds have continued to flow into the bond market, and allocation demand has pushed long-term yields downward. Among them, the 30Y government bond yield closed at 2.43%, down 12bp from May; the 10Y government bond yield closed at 2.21%, down 8bp from May; the 10-year CDB bond yield closed at 2.29%, down 10bp from May. On July 1, the central bank announced its decision to carry out treasury bond borrowing operations in the near future for some primary dealers in the open market business. The yields on the bond market rose accordingly, with the 10Y treasury bond yields rising 4bp to 2.27%, and the 30Y treasury bond yields rising 5bp to 2.27%. 2.48%. On July 8, the central bank issued an announcement stating that it would carry out temporary forward repurchase or temporary reverse repurchase operations depending on the situation. This temporary forward and reverse repurchase operation was regarded as a signal to reconstruct the """"interest rate corridor"""" and restart the operation that had been suspended for many years. Positive repurchase transactions are regarded as an adjustment tool for the lower limit of interest rates, and the bond market has corrected again. Among them, short-term 3Y and 5Y government bonds have been adjusted by 3-5bp, and were traded at 1.84% and 2.02% respectively that day. After the release of financial data, market feedback was consistent with expectations. In terms of key term interest rates for interest rate bonds, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y and 10Y treasury bonds reached 1.80%, 1.98%, 2.12% and 2.27% respectively. In terms of ultra-long term, 30Y and 50Y treasury bonds respectively Reached 2.47% and 2.51%; 3Y, 5Y, 7Y and 10Y CDB bonds reached 1.96%, 2.07%, 2.20% and 2.33% respectively.",,,,
5. Prospects: Social integration and M2 growth are expected to pick up,,,,
"Overall, although the financial data is still slightly downward, first of all, it reflects the year-on-year changes under the """"light total"""" target, especially the impact of the end-of-quarter impulse in the same period last year that pushed up the base; secondly, in the """"emphasis on quality and efficiency"""" Under the requirements, changes in total volume cannot accurately reflect the real needs of the real economy. On the one hand, policies pay more attention to guiding the revitalization of stock, and through the transfer of loans, more loans are invested in key areas and weak links such as the """"Five Big Articles"""" of finance; on the other hand, with the in-depth adjustment of the real estate industry, high-tech manufacturing, light asset services The industry\'s contribution to economic growth continues to increase, but its reliance on credit resources is not high. Looking forward, considering that macro policies may intensify in the second half of the year and the impact of the high base subsides, the growth rate of social integration and M2 will gradually pick up in the future.",,,,
"What incremental policies will there be for economic journalists? 1) In terms of fiscal policy: This year’s proactive fiscal policy has attracted market attention. The fiscal policy\'s 3% deficit rate and 4.06 trillion deficit scale arrangement are basically consistent with the outlook in our """"2024 Local Two Sessions Observation and National Two Sessions Forecast"""". The clarification of the key investment areas at the press conference will not only help the transformation of the economic structure into new and old driving forces, but can also be combined with the large-scale equipment renewal policy that is being studied and launched. In addition, of the 1 trillion additional treasury bonds issued in the fourth quarter of last year, 700 billion will be used this year due to the later issuance time, and the incremental contribution slightly exceeds expectations. At the same time, the government continues to emphasize the need to live a tight life, and the government\'s """"three public services"""" expenditures may continue to be tightened. 2) Equipment renewal and consumer goods replacement: According to estimates by the National Development and Reform Commission, the market size of equipment renewal is about 5 trillion, and the market size of durable consumer goods replacement is trillions. Calculated based on this scale, they will account for 10% of the annual GDP in 2023. 4% and 0.8%. 3) Capital market: It clarified the positioning of the capital market, emphasized the need to pay attention to the balanced development of investment and financing, and emphasized three points in subsequent construction: First, it emphasized the protection of investors, especially small and medium-sized investors. The second is to emphasize improving the quality of listed companies. The third is to further improve the basic system.",,,,
"The last large-scale device update is a thing of the past. The last round of encouraging trade-in of consumer goods in china can be traced back to the “Home Appliances to the Rural Areas” campaign promoted by the State Council in December 2008 and the “Old-for-New” campaign for automobiles and home appliances carried out on the basis of the “Home Appliances to the Rural Areas” program in May 2009. The main purpose is to expand domestic demand, improve people\'s livelihood, stimulate consumption to drive production, and promote stable and rapid economic growth. It has been more than 13 years since the """"Home Appliances to the Countryside"""" program started in December 2008. Considering that most of the previous round of home appliances have exceeded their useful life and have safety hazards, as well as the technological innovation content of the new generation of home appliances, a new round of consumer goods trade-in has been launched. It is very necessary, which is conducive to activating the domestic consumption economic cycle, and will also help destocking and increasing capacity utilization in some midstream manufacturing industries.",,,,
"Macro data tracking. 1) New energy is being destocked and the price war is still continuing. An important reason for the sharp month-on-month and year-on-year declines in February was the difference in pre-holiday consumption time caused by the Spring Festival. In January, the overall inventory of pure new energy vehicle companies dropped to 370,000 vehicles, of which the inventory in new energy dealer channels dropped significantly. 2) This year’s March 8th Women’s Day shows a diversified trend. Consumer entertainment activities such as dining out, participating in theme activities, shopping, watching movies, and attending concerts/livehouses are more popular. 3) AI: In the global list of global AI products, the number of visits in February varied. ChatGPT and NewBing have far more visits than others. Domestic Baidu Netdisk and Doubao are on the global APP growth list, with Doubao increasing by as much as 567%. 4) The pattern of overseas short dramas is stable. Thanks to its early overseas deployment, data such as revenue and downloads have widened the gap with others.",,,,
"Stock market: With the calendar effect of the two sessions and the decline in demand for stability, this round of rapid oversold rebound may gradually move towards a volatile market under resistance. Further testing of subsequent economic data, macro policies and market expectations is required. Under high odds, whether the winning rate can be effectively improved is the key to whether the reversal starts. However, we have not yet seen a significant improvement in the macro fundamentals at the margin, which means that the molecular end is still weak, and in terms of incremental With capital inflow expected to gradually slow down, investor expectations and market risk appetite may remain key factors disturbing the market. The market outlook for this round of rebound may gradually give way to fundamental logic and industrial logic.",,,,
"Bond market: The game surrounding the long-term downside space has intensified, and fluctuations in long-term interest rates may increase in stages. Judging from the bond lending situation, from the end of the year to March 8, the loan concentration ratio of 10Y230026 increased from 38.9% to 48.3%, and the loan concentration ratio of 30Y230023 increased from 16.2% to 32.9%. With long-term interest rates continuing to hit record lows, The pressure to continue to be long is also increasing, and the differences between long and short are still quite large. We need to be wary of the risk of amplified fluctuations in long-term interest rates in the short term. We may shorten the duration appropriately and wait for the high volatility phase to pass.",,,,
"Commodities: With commodity prices currently fluctuating at high levels, expectations of overseas interest rate cuts increasing, and demand for gold purchases increasing, gold prices are expected to continue to rise. Under the combined influence of favorable overseas macroeconomic resonance and the expected recovery of domestic demand, commodities are expected to continue a steady upward trend as a whole. At the same time, the situation in the Red Sea remains tense, and geopolitical risks still exist or may provide further support.",,,,

Global Inventory Cycle Scale: Economic Upside,,,,
"If we take August 2023 as the starting point (the second bottom in the first half of 2023), the global manufacturing PMI will enter the expansion range in January 2024.

"In US dollars, China\'s exports grew by -6.4% in October 2023, imports increased by 3%, and the trade surplus narrowed to US$56.53 billion.",,,,
Peaceful perspective:,,,,
"1. The export growth rate is weaker than market expectations, and holidays have a greater impact on the export rhythm. China\'s export growth in U.S. dollars in October fell 0.2 percentage points from the previous month to -6.4%, lower than Wind\'s consensus forecast of -3.1%. 1) Data fluctuations between months have an impact. In the past ten years, the month-on-month growth rate of exports in September and October has mostly shown a """"one waxing and waning"""" trend. In September this year, China\'s exports were stronger than the same period in history, while in October they fell back, showing normal monthly fluctuations. 2) Judging from high-frequency data, exports in October were low at first and then high, and the performance at the end of the month was not weak. The Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday may have disturbed the export rhythm. We tend to believe that the decline in export growth in October is phased. Based on base and high-frequency data analysis, China\'s export growth rate from November to December has the basis for further recovery, and the monthly year-on-year growth rate is still expected to turn from negative to positive.",,,,
"2. The structure of exports by country is """"ebbing and flowing"""", which is reflected in the fact that areas with strong export improvement in September weakened marginally in October, while areas with weak export performance in September recovered in October, which can also be seen. The impact of data fluctuations from month to month. In October, the drag on China\'s exports from the United States and ASEAN decreased by 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points respectively, and they did not recover in September; the drag on China\'s exports from the EU, Japan, and South Korea expanded by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 percentage points respectively, and the three The repair was strong in September.",,,,
"3. In terms of export product structure, mechanical and electrical products and labor-intensive products have enlarged their drag on China’s exports.",,,,
"1) The drag of mechanical and electrical products on overall exports expanded by 0.4 percentage points. The projects with increased marginal drag were integrated circuits, automatic data processing equipment and their parts. However, the export of automobiles and their parts to China maintained a positive pull, and mobile phones China\'s export growth has turned from a drag to a support. 2) The drag of labor-intensive products on overall exports expanded by 0.6 percentage points. 3) Except for electromechanical and labor-intensive products, the drag of other products on exports has weakened. In particular, refined oil products have boosted China’s export growth by 0.5 percentage points, compared with a drag of 0.5 percentage points in September.",,,,
"4. The drag of price factors on China’s exports has not been significantly alleviated. From the perspective of historical correlation, the RJ/CRB commodity price index leads China\'s export price index by about 6 months. In this cycle, the year-on-year growth rate of the RJ/CRB commodity price index hit the bottom in May 2023, and the latest September data of China’s export price index still hovered at a low level. Products with published export prices have seen mixed gains and losses: the year-on-year growth rate of the average export price of raw material products such as grain, refined oil, steel, unwrought aluminum, and aluminum has increased compared with September; integrated circuits, LCD panels, household appliances, The year-on-year growth rate of the average export price of shoes and boots and other products fell compared with September.",,,,
"5. China’s import growth rate is impressive. In October 2023, China\'s import growth rate in U.S. dollars was 3%, which was a strong improvement compared to the -6.2% growth rate in September.

"2) Raw material products contributed 2.5 percentage points to China’s import growth, an increase of 3.5 percentage points from September.

The Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday may have disturbed the export rhythm. After the holidays, Shanghai and Ningbo export container freight indexes rebounded quickly. The port cargo throughput and container throughput announced by the Ministry of Transport weakened in the first week of October and rebounded quickly in the next three weeks, including the fourth week of October. (October 23-29) port cargo throughput hit a new high since May last year. We tend to believe that the decline in export growth in October is phased.

Not only does it cover a wide range of objects, but the content of supervision is also different from traditional accounting. There is a difference between supervision and accounting supervision. It is neither """"financial + accounting"""" supervision in a narrow sense, nor a simple sum of financial supervision, financial supervision and accounting supervision in the traditional sense, but a comprehensive integration of the three that are organically integrated and intertwined. Covered supervisory actions.

Ensure that the results of supervision are implemented. The fourth is to integrate and promote the work of financial and accounting supervision and service representative committees, and make them organically connect. Based on the opinions, proposals and work characteristics of representative members, """"invite"""" representative members in relevant fields to participate in financial supervision inspections, performance evaluations, investigations and research, etc., and carefully solicit the opinions and suggestions of representative members on work plans and regulatory issues, both to improve It improves the accuracy and effectiveness of service work, strives for the understanding and support of financial work from representative members, and effectively promotes the improvement of the level and quality of financial supervision work. The main responsible comrades of the bureau also made a special trip to visit relevant representatives and members to report and exchange on the implementation of financial and accounting supervision work arrangements and strengthening cooperation with disciplinary inspection and other departments, striving to promote the synergy of financial and accounting supervision, and jointly contribute to promoting the high-quality economic and social development of Hainan.",,,,
"In order to thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress and the relevant tasks and requirements of the 2024 Government Work Report, further improve the basic medical insurance for urban and rural residents, continuously enhance the basic medical insurance capacity, and strive to relieve the people\'s worries about medical treatment, the National Health Insurance Administration, together with the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, issued the """"Notice on Doing a Good Job in the Basic Medical Insurance for Urban and Rural Residents in 2024"""" (Medical Insurance [2024] No. 19), hereinafter referred to as the """"Notice""""). The relevant contents are interpreted as follows:",,,,
1. How will the financing of residents’ medical insurance be arranged in 2024?,,,,
"In order to actively adapt to the situation of growing life expectancy and rising medical consumption levels, and to consolidate and improve the level of residents\' medical insurance benefits, the Notice clearly states that in 2024, governments at all levels will continue to increase subsidies for residents\' medical insurance premiums, while the increase in personal contributions by residents will be appropriately reduced. The fiscal subsidy and personal contribution standards will increase by 30 yuan and 20 yuan respectively compared with the previous year, and will not be less than 670 yuan and 400 yuan per person per year, respectively. This is the first time since 2016 that the new personal contribution standard has been lower than the fiscal subsidy standard. It should be noted that, against the backdrop of growing life expectancy and rising medical consumption levels, it is an objective need to reasonably increase personal contributions and fiscal subsidy standards to consolidate and improve the level of benefits and ensure the smooth operation of the system. In addition, the Notice also requires the simultaneous optimization of the financing structure of serious illness insurance, emphasizing that fiscal subsidies at all levels should be allocated in full and in a timely manner in accordance with regulations, and should not be squeezed or misappropriated.",,,,
2. What are the specific requirements for residents’ medical insurance benefits in 2024?,,,,
"In order to effectively enhance the sense of gain of the masses in participating in the insurance, the """"Notice"""" clearly requires the steady improvement of the level of basic medical insurance, the enhancement of the precise protection capacity of major disease insurance, and the strengthening of the protection of medical expenses for childbirth under the residents\' medical insurance. First, continue to consolidate the level of hospitalization benefits, steadily improve the level of outpatient protection, and comprehensively promote the implementation of the family mutual aid policy of personal accounts of employee medical insurance. Second, reasonably determine the deductible standard, reimbursement ratio and maximum payment limit of major disease insurance, and improve the accuracy of protection of high medical expenses for patients with major diseases. Third, include prenatal examination fees in outpatient protection, and reasonably improve the level of protection for medical expenses for hospitalization, childbirth and childbirth. The """"Notice"""" particularly emphasizes the promotion of standardized and unified systems and policies, requiring all provinces to organize a """"look back"""" on the three-year action plan for the list of medical insurance benefits, actively and steadily promote the provincial-level coordination of basic medical insurance, explore incentive and constraint measures for continuous insurance in accordance with the direction clearly defined by the state, and gradually unify the centralized collection period.",,,,
3. How to do a solid job in consolidating the achievements of the medical insurance poverty alleviation campaign in the second half of the transition period?,,,,
"The Notice requires the implementation of comprehensive medical insurance assistance policies, the establishment of a long-term mechanism to prevent and resolve the return to poverty due to illness, and the participation of low-income rural population and people out of poverty in insurance, ensuring that the participation rate of the two types of people is not less than 99%. First, the policy of classified medical assistance and insurance subsidies should be implemented in accordance with regulations. Regions with conditions can moderately increase the quota subsidy standards and increase preferential assistance in light of actual conditions. Second, regular monitoring and early warning of patients with high medical expenses should be carried out, information sharing and inter-departmental coordination should be further strengthened, and social forces such as charity should be actively guided to participate in assistance and protection.",,,,
4. What incentives are there to encourage residents to continue participating in insurance and paying premiums?,,,,
"Recently, the General Office of the State Council issued the """"Guiding Opinions on Improving the Long-term Mechanism for Participation in Basic Medical Insurance"""", which clearly proposed to establish an incentive mechanism for serious illness insurance benefits for continuous residents\' medical insurance participants and zero reimbursement participants. The """"Notice"""" requires all provinces to set up corresponding incentive measures for continuous insured persons in accordance with the clear direction of the state and strictly implement them. The continuous insurance incentive is to participate in insurance for 4 consecutive years. After that, you can enjoy the continuous insurance incentive for each consecutive year of insurance, and the maximum payment limit of serious illness insurance will be increased according to regulations; the zero reimbursement incentive is zero reimbursement of the fund in the current year, and you can enjoy the incentive in the next year, and the maximum payment limit of serious illness insurance will be increased according to regulations. The two measures are set up independently and will be implemented from 2025. For those who meet the incentive conditions, the maximum payment limit of serious illness insurance will be increased, and each increase will not be less than 1,000 yuan, which is much higher than the 400 yuan paid by individuals. If a serious illness reimbursement occurs in the current year and the zero reimbursement reward amount is used, although the zero reimbursement incentive amount is recalculated in the second year, it will not affect the continuous insurance incentive. For continuous insurance incentives, even if the insured resident stops the insurance, the continuous insurance years will be recalculated, but the continuous insurance incentive amount will be retained. Through incentives, insured residents are encouraged to strengthen their own health management and continue to pay insurance premiums. Continuous insured persons can obtain higher protection, which fundamentally protects the interests of all insured persons and ensures the smooth operation of the fund.",,,,
5. How to improve people’s sense of gain by incorporating village clinics into medical insurance designated management?,,,,
"As the most basic medical institution, the village clinic is the foundation of the rural medical and health service system, the first stop for rural residents to see a doctor, and the """"last mile"""" to achieve medical security services. Including village clinics in the designated medical insurance management is of great significance to continuously meet the growing medical security needs of rural people and improve the accessibility of medical treatment and medicine for common and frequently occurring diseases. Recently, the National Medical Insurance Administration, together with the National Health Commission, issued the """"Notice on Accelerating the Promotion of the Inclusion of Village Clinics in the Designated Medical Insurance Management"""", guiding all localities to accelerate the inclusion of village clinics in the designated medical insurance management in accordance with the principle of """"creating conditions, optimizing processes, strengthening scheduling, and including as many as possible"""", ensuring that eligible village clinics will be included in the medical insurance settlement scope in a timely manner before the end of 2024, and that administrative villages with multiple village clinics will ensure that at least one village clinic is included in the designated medical insurance management, ensuring that medical insurance services are """"accessible to every village"""", and facilitating people to seek medical treatment and purchase medicine at their doorsteps. Support village doctors to carry out family doctor contracting services, carry out door-to-door inspections, preventive health care, chronic disease management, and traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment services for participation in insurance mobilization. As of April 2024, there are 580,000 village clinics in normal operation across the country, of which 100,000 are included in the scope of independent medical insurance designation, and another 320,000 village clinics adopt the """"rural integration"""" management model and realize medical insurance reimbursement through township health centers. More than 72% of village clinics across the country have been included in the medical insurance payment scope.",,,,
6. Can the personal accounts of employees’ medical insurance be shared with family members participating in urban and rural residents’ medical insurance?,,,,
"""""Family mutual aid can participate in insurance, helping the elderly and the young"""". The """"Guiding Opinions on Improving the Long-term Mechanism for Participation in Basic Medical Insurance"""" recently issued by the General Office of the State Council clearly stated that the mutual aid scope of employee medical insurance personal accounts will be expanded to close relatives. Among them, close relatives refer to spouses, parents, children, brothers and sisters, grandparents, grandparents, grandchildren, and grandchildren as stipulated in the """"Civil Code"""". Employee medical insurance personal accounts can be used to pay the personal contributions of close relatives to participate in resident medical insurance. Close relatives participating in basic medical insurance can also use the personal accounts of related employee medical insurance participants to settle when reimbursing medical expenses. The """"Notice"""" requires the comprehensive promotion of the implementation of the policy on family mutual aid use of employee medical insurance personal accounts. The National Medical Insurance Administration will actively promote the further expansion of the geographical scope of mutual aid, strive to achieve mutual aid within all provinces before the end of this year, and accelerate the promotion of cross-provincial mutual aid next year.",,,,
"In order to effectively organize and implement the policy, the """"Notice"""" requires all localities and relevant departments to strengthen organizational leadership, improve work mechanisms, consolidate work responsibilities, strengthen departmental coordination, enhance risk awareness, strengthen fund management, do a good job in publicity and interpretation, and promote the implementation of systems and policies in detail and effectively safeguard the medical insurance rights and interests of the people.",,,,
"According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervision Commission, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Team of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervision Commission at the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Guangdong Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision: Yao Qian, Director of the Science and Technology Supervision Department and Director of the Information Center of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation.

"In the first quarter of 2024, the global economy will still maintain a weak recovery, some economies will continue to be under pressure, and weak demand will still be the main drag factor. The global manufacturing industry ended its 17 consecutive months of operating below 50% and returned to the expansion range. Inflation levels have fallen overall. Among developed economies, the U.S. economic resilience still exists, while European economic vitality is still insufficient. Japan has started to raise interest rates to end negative interest rates. Looking forward to the second quarter, the rhythm and pace of global economic recovery are still wavering. Uncertainty continues to increase under the influence of geopolitical conflicts. The monetary policies of some developed economies are expected to reach an inflection point between the second quarter and the second half of the year.",,,,
"In the first quarter of 2024, the domestic economy got off to a good start, with stronger endogenous driving forces for economic growth, better-than-expected consumption performance, accelerated growth in manufacturing investment, stable recovery of production, accelerated industrial transformation and upgrading driven by new quality productivity, and the bottom of the economy is gradually clear .",,,,
"Looking ahead to the second quarter, industrial production is expected to continue running smoothly. On the premise that operating income and operating profit margins maintain good growth rates, the profitability of industrial companies is expected to continue to improve. With the support of policies that encourage and promote the trade-in of consumer goods, consumption growth potential is expected to continue to be released; high-tech manufacturing investment is an important carrier of economic growth momentum, and infrastructure investment is expected to underpin fixed asset investment driven by central support and local special bond issuance. Steady operation, accelerated construction of the """"three major projects"""" are expected to further alleviate the downward trend in real estate demand; the """"three new"""" export advantages continue to lead foreign trade to maintain resilience. The continuous release of the potential of service consumption demand will help push the CPI back to a moderate range; infrastructure investment is expected to drive a rebound in demand for industrial products and narrow the decline in PPI.",,,,
"Looking forward to the second quarter, to lay a solid foundation for economic recovery and strengthen market expectations, policies still need to be further refined and implemented. Fiscal policy will continue to be appropriately intensified to improve quality and efficiency, continue to accelerate fiscal and tax reform, optimize the fiscal revenue structure, and focus on equipment renewal and technological transformation. The focus of the policy will continue to focus on supporting scientific and technological innovation and the development of high-tech manufacturing; monetary policy Continue to be flexible, appropriate, precise and effective, and encourage and guide financial institutions to increase financial support for technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises and technological transformation and equipment update projects in key areas. In terms of credit support, digital, intelligent, high-end, green technological transformation and equipment update projects will be the focus.",,,,

"Focus on industry areas with foundations, scenarios, and needs—promote the multiplier effect of data elements",,,,
"According to information released by the recently held National Data Work Conference, preliminary calculations show that my country’s total data production is expected to exceed 32ZB in 2023 (1ZB is approximately equal to 10 trillion bytes). As a global data power, our country’s future development direction is to create more value from flowing data.",,,,
"As a new factor of production, data is rapidly integrated into all aspects of production, distribution, circulation, consumption, and social service management, becoming an important driving force for high-quality economic and social development. The National Data Administration and 17 other departments jointly issued the """"Data Elements ×"""" Three-Year Action Plan (2024-2026), which proposed a series of goals such as significantly expanding the breadth and depth of data element applications by the end of 2026.",,,,
Promote low-cost multi-scenario reuse of data and improve total factor productivity,,,,
"""""There are currently problems such as insufficient release of data application potential, low supply quality, and poor circulation mechanisms. The \'Data Element ×\' action is to promote the application of data in multiple scenarios, improve resource allocation efficiency, create new industries and new models, and cultivate and develop new The three-year action has the following main features:",,,,
"From connection to collaboration, from interconnection based on data generation and transmission to global optimization based on effective use of data, further improving total factor productivity; by mining useful information from data, we can find out where enterprises, industries, and industries are constrained by factor resources. """"optimal solution"""". For example, opening up the data of the manufacturing industry chain enables efficient collaborative R&D and manufacturing between upstream and downstream parts factories and OEMs in the supply chain, effectively shortening the R&D cycle, reducing supply chain costs, and creating products with higher quality and better performance.",,,,
"From use to reuse, from the use of Internet technology in thousands of industries to value creation based on inter-industry data reuse, expanding new space for economic growth. For example, in the field of new energy power generation, future power generation is a key factor in determining project investment returns. However, affected by weather, there are large uncertainties and unpredictable random fluctuations, and investment risks are high. By integrating meteorological and power generation historical data, new energy companies and insurance institutions can establish power generation fluctuation models, lock in profits in advance, and develop insurance products based on future power generation.",,,,
"From superposition to integration, from efficiency improvement supported by data aggregation to the emergence of innovation driven by the integration of data from multiple sources and types, cultivating new drivers of economic growth. The integration of data of different types and dimensions will promote the integration of knowledge in different fields, promote the innovation and upgrading of production tools, and give birth to new industries and new models. For example, in the field of autonomous driving, no single data source can achieve true intelligence. Fully autonomous driving must be achieved through vehicle intelligence and vehicle-road collaboration.",,,,
"Jiang Xiaojuan, president of the China Industrial Economics Society and professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes: “The most prominent feature of data elements is that they can be reused in multiple scenarios at low cost. A set of data can be reused by different subjects in different ways, and can be deconstructed, reorganized, Through methods such as convergence and integration, more value can be mined through multi-level diversification, achieving knowledge diffusion, market expansion and value doubling, and improving total factor productivity.”",,,,
Select 12 industries and fields in advance to clarify typical application scenarios,,,,
Which industries can effectively leverage the value of data?,,,,
"Shen Zhulin said that in accordance with the principle of """"having a foundation, having a scenario, and having a demand"""", the National Data Administration has selected 12 industries and fields in advance based on the current development situation to promote the multiplier effect of data elements.",,,,
"""""In these industries and fields, there are abundant data resources, extensive application requirements, and multi-level interactive chains, which have a good application foundation and broad development space."""" Jiang Xiaojuan said.",,,,
"For example, in the agricultural field, there is a large demand for data collaboration, but business entities are relatively scattered, data circulation in various aspects of agricultural production is not smooth, and the degree of development and utilization of data resources is low. In this regard, collaboration will be strengthened to promote the integration and utilization of data across the entire chain of environment, nutrients, growth, sales, storage, and processing to improve agricultural production efficiency.",,,,
"For example, in the financial field, there is a huge demand for data from other industries. By introducing data from technology, environmental protection, pensions, medical care, social security and other fields, financial institutions can improve credit models and assist in loan and credit decision-making for small, medium and micro enterprises, while reducing the bad debt rate of financial institutions. At the same time, it will better empower the development of the real economy.",,,,
"The value of data aggregation in the science and technology field is high, and it is planned to promote the integration of multiple data and cultivate new models and new business formats. Taking chemical and chemical process design as an example, experiments with different compounds or process methods take a lot of time and are inefficient. Through the aggregation and integration of basic experimental data such as structure and physical properties, combined with scientific analysis of process data, efficient screening of optimal scientific research solutions can be achieved.",,,,
"Data in the meteorological field are highly versatile, and it is planned to promote data openness and improve the quality of data supply. Meteorological data can empower the development of agriculture, transportation, energy, tourism and other fields, and can be used in many scenarios such as meteorological disaster monitoring and early warning, grain yield prediction, traffic emergency response to severe weather conditions, ship navigation, coal, electricity, oil and gas transportation regulation, forest fire prevention and extinguishing, etc. play a role in.",,,,

"Since the launch of the theme education on studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the autonomous region\'s finance has insisted on """"thinking long-term and doing practical things"""". On the basis of solidly completing the """"prescribed actions"""", it has actively innovated """"characteristic actions"""" to promote the economy of the autonomous region. Be innovative and strong while improving both quality and efficiency.",,,,
"1. Seizing the opportunity of economic recovery, fiscal revenue reached a record high",,,,
"General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: """"In any work, we have to talk about both the two points and the key points. If there is no priority, no distinction, and just grabbing the eyebrows and beards, we will not be able to do a good job."""" The autonomous region\'s finance seizes the direction of economic recovery. During the critical period, scientifically analyze the key tasks of the organization\'s revenue work in different periods and stages, clarify work ideas, prioritize, focus on the """"acupuncture points"""", grasp the key points, and make full efforts to promote fiscal revenue to new highs.",,,,
"The first is to focus on income and draw good points, lines and surfaces. Counties and cities focus on """"points"""". On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the income of organizations in 96 counties and cities in the region, one-on-one verification and point-to-point analysis are carried out for key counties and cities with low income completion, and the organizational strength is fully targeted. The prefectures and prefectures grasped the """"line"""". In view of the emerging and tendentious problems that emerged in the key income indicators of 14 prefectures, prefectures and cities, the department leaders personally made arrangements and carried out """"line"""" penetrating analysis on key contents such as non-tax revenue operations to improve Financial revenue quality and effectiveness. The whole district focuses on the """"face"""", and on the basis of point and line portraits, conducts video scheduling meetings for the district\'s organizational revenue work based on weekly, ten-day, monthly and other time nodes, and analyzes the revenue completion numbers of key counties and cities on a weekly basis and the completion of indicators in various regions. The situation is analyzed on a ten-day basis and the district\'s fiscal revenue trends are analyzed on a monthly basis to comprehensively reflect the overall situation of fiscal revenue and expenditure operations.",,,,
"The second is to promote improvement and relieve blockage, pain and difficulty. In view of the problems such as the impact of lower commodity prices in the autonomous region that has not been eliminated and the limited upward space for non-tax revenue, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the root causes of financial difficulties in key areas, identified shortcomings and pain points, and put forward targeted rationalization suggestions. In the district-wide organization revenue dispatch meeting, department leaders proposed to effectively strengthen the management of tourism ticket revenue and improve the quality of fiscal revenue in areas such as Ili Prefecture and Altay with many tourist attractions. At the same time, it emphasized the need to increase the transfer of mineral resources and promote local fiscal revenue levels to further increase.",,,,
"2. Adhere to innovation, integrated development, and technological empowerment to create broad space",,,,
"The confidence of an economy depends not only on the current static """"shape"""" but also on the """"potential"""" of long-term development. Today, the autonomous region’s innovation system continues to improve, its innovation power gradually strengthens, and its innovation momentum becomes more prosperous. Multiple innovation elements stimulate each other, and expertise in multiple fields assists each other, forming new innovation-driven advantages and promoting economic development with better efficiency, higher quality, and sustainable development. Sex is better.",,,,
"First, the innovation factor is exerting force, and the """"gold content"""" of economic development is higher. The creative assertion that """"science and technology is the primary productive force"""" has effectively promoted the development of china\'s social productive forces, and the proposal of new quality productive forces has further consolidated the status of science and technology as the primary productive force. china\'s traditional industries are faced with problems such as fierce market competition, large resource consumption, and serious environmental pollution. They urgently need to find new growth points and breakthroughs. The autonomous region pays more attention to technological innovation and actively cultivates future industries to accelerate the formation of new productivity. From January to October 2023, there were 297 wind photovoltaic power generation construction projects in the autonomous region, with completed investment increasing 1.6 times year-on-year, driving investment growth by 10.2 percentage points. Among them, investment in photovoltaic power generation projects increased by 1.8 times, accounting for 67.3%. The vigorous development of new products and new business formats will generate a strong internal driving force for the economic development of the autonomous region, promote further increase in fiscal revenue, and form a new driving force for economic growth.",,,,
"Second, the innovation mechanism is improved and the potential for economic development is greater. Behind the rise of new driving forces are the dividends released by a series of institutional reforms such as """"fair competition"""" and """"tax and fee reductions"""". It is a reflection of the continuous increase in investment in science and technology expenditures by finance at all levels and provides benefits to thousands of market entities. Create an external environment where we want to innovate, dare to innovate, and can innovate. The autonomous region has successively implemented reforms such as inclusive tax reductions and exemptions for small and micro enterprises and a comprehensive reduction of value-added tax. From January to November 2023, the region’s science and technology expenditure increased by 56.3% year-on-year. Through the """"subtraction"""" of government power and the """"tightening of finance"""" in exchange for the """"multiplication"""" of innovation, more new surprises that will lead to high-quality economic development will surely be born.",,,,
"3. The vitality of flowering in many areas has appeared, and the full-year income target has been accelerated.",,,,

"First, the value of mining resources is released at an accelerated pace, and the economic development of the region is accelerated. The autonomous region accelerates the green development and efficient utilization of mineral resources, intensifies the """"recruitment, auction and listing"""" of mineral resources to maximize potential and increase income, turning """"sleeping minerals"""" into """"living water for increasing income"""".",,,,
"Second, positive factors in economic operation have accumulated, and fiscal revenue has embarked on an upward curve. Since 2023, the autonomous region\'s general public budget revenue has continued to maintain a high growth rate, and the growth rate has been rising in the first half of the year. With the substantial growth of the autonomous region\'s consumption scene, investment growth has continued to accelerate, industrial growth has accelerated across the board, fiscal foreign trade has grown rapidly, and the autonomous region\'s economy has improved.

The economy continued to show that production was stronger than domestic demand, but what needs to be paid attention to is that in the first quarter, net exports contributed more to GDP. Obviously, as the United States further imposes tariffs on some Chinese products, the stimulation of external demand may weaken marginally, and expanding domestic demand may be the policy focus in the next stage.",,,,
"In April, the industrial added value increased by 6.7% year-on-year. From January to April, the cumulative industrial added value of the mining industry increased by 1.7% year-on-year. The cumulative year-on-year growth rate of the manufacturing industry was 6.9%. The cumulative year-on-year growth rate of public utilities was 6.6%. The cumulative year-on-year growth rate of the high-tech industry The speed is 8.4%.",,,,
"In April, retail sales increased by 2.3% year-on-year, of which retail sales of consumer goods other than automobiles increased by 3.2% year-on-year. From January to April, service consumption increased by 8.4% year-on-year.",,,,
"The growth rate of fixed asset investment from January to April was 4.2%, the growth rate of private fixed asset investment was 0.3%, the cumulative year-on-year growth rate of manufacturing investment from January to April was 9.7%, the cumulative year-on-year growth rate of infrastructure investment was 6.0%, and the cumulative year-on-year growth rate of real estate investment was 9.8%. .",,,,
"From January to April, the cumulative area of \u200b\u200bnew real estate construction fell by 24.6% year-on-year, the construction area fell by 10.8% year-on-year, and the completed area fell by 20.4% year-on-year. The sales area of \u200b\u200bcommercial housing decreased by 20.2% year-on-year, and the cumulative sales volume of commercial housing decreased by 28.3% year-on-year. Among sources of funds, the proportion and growth rate of self-raised funds increased compared with January to March, and the improvement was obvious. Although the proportion and growth rate of deposits and mortgages from individuals also increased compared with January to March, the overall year-on-year growth rate At a low level, commercial housing sales have not improved significantly.",,,,
"Economic data in April were slightly divided internally. Compared with March economic data, the year-on-year growth rate of industrial added value in April increased, while the growth rate of social retail and fixed investment declined. Compared with Wind's consensus expectation, the year-on-year growth rate of industrial added value in April exceeded expectations, and the growth rate of social retail and fixed investment declined. Investment growth was lower than expected. Broken down, the overall performance of the manufacturing industry is still strong, fixed asset investment maintains a high growth rate, and the year-on-year growth rate of industrial added value is also at a high level; both social retail and fixed investment are affected to varying degrees by the base number of the same period last year. , In addition, the main reasons for the weak growth rate of fixed investment are the drag of real estate and the monthly fluctuations in the growth rate of infrastructure investment. The main reasons for the weak growth rate of social retail investment are: first, the release of household consumption is slow, and consumption preferences are tilted towards necessities. Firstly, the real estate category is generally weak in the post-cyclical period. Thirdly, the prices of goods and services are weak, which also has a certain impact on the nominal growth rate of social retail.",,,,
"External demand is the short-term bright spot of my country's economy, and in the medium term, we will focus on policies to expand domestic demand. Economic data in April continued the structure and characteristics of the first quarter. Domestically, the overall performance of the production side was strong, but domestic demand was weak, and the marginal contribution of external demand to the economy was relatively large: in the first quarter, net exports contributed 0.77 percentage points to GDP. Far exceeding the -0.28 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023 and the average of -0.02 percentage points in the first quarter from 2015 to 2019. However, as the United States announced on May 14 that it would further increase tariffs on electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic cells and other products imported from my country on top of the original Section 301 tariffs on China, there is a risk of marginal weakening of external demand. We believe that expanding domestic demand is the focus of the next stage of stabilizing growth. Macroeconomic policies may focus on four aspects. First, further implement fiscal and monetary policies to promote investment in manufacturing. Second, promote the release of household consumption through policies such as trade-in for new and bulk consumer goods going to the countryside. The third is to rationally arrange the rhythm of the issuance and use of government bond financing to avoid large fluctuations in the growth rate of infrastructure investment from month to month. The fourth is to coordinate national policies and one-city-one policies to stabilize the real estate market, and guide the real estate industry trends to realize their goals. The bottom is good.",,,,
Risk warning: Global inflation is falling slowly; there are uncertainties in U.S. economic and financial fundamentals; the international situation is complicated.,,,,
"Tengjing Macro's high-frequency simulation shows that the U.S. CPI dropped slightly year-on-year in January, or 3.0%, continuing to remain high. International crude oil prices fell year-on-year this month, driving the CPI downward; core service items mostly cooled down, and commodity items may remain the same as the previous value. In terms of items, this month's core CPI is expected to be 3.8% year-on-year, down 0.1 percentage points from the previous month; CPI energy has fallen year-on-year after rising in December last year, and is expected to drop 3.1 percentage points this month to -5.1%; food items this month Still maintaining a downward trend, or 2.6%.",,,,
"Gasoline prices fell in January year-on-year after a brief rise in December, and natural gas prices rebounded year-on-year after continuing to fall in November and December last year. U.S. premium gasoline retail prices fell 5.6% year-on-year. Among core commodities, the price index of second-hand cars has resumed a downward trend after a slight rebound year-on-year. At the same time, among core services, the owner-equivalent rent and the rent of main residence have formed a steady downward trend, driving core inflation to continue to decline. However, the current cooling rate of core inflation is slow.",,,,

The preliminary comprehensive PMI value was 52.3, higher than the expected 51, and also a new high since July. The previous value was 50.9. The U.S. consumer confidence index rose to 114.8 in January from 108 in December, continuing the upward trend in December.",,,,
"In December last year, U.S. CPI growth slightly exceeded market expectations, with a year-on-year increase of 3.4%, 3.2% expected, and the previous value of 3.1%; core CPI increased by 3.9% year-on-year, 4% lower than the previous value, and 3.8% higher than expected. In December, the core CPI, which is the center of inflation, was difficult to decline due to the resilience of commodity items. The low base in the same period last year affected the year-on-year rebound in energy prices, which was the main reason for the upward trend in CPI. Overall, U.S. CPI should continue to slow down in the first quarter of 2024. However, due to the strong resilience of core inflation, it is still difficult for the United States to achieve the 2% inflation target.",,,,
"Core point of view: China and Vietnam jointly declared that the two sides will cooperate in railway construction in the field of infrastructure, and China will provide support for Vietnam\'s standard-gauge railway projects. There is new progress in China\'s infrastructure going overseas. Infrastructure going overseas will help improve the level of connectivity between China and Southeast Asian countries, help drive the development of infrastructure industries such as railways in ASEAN countries, and also have positive significance for China\'s exports to Southeast Asia and cultivating new foreign trade momentum. It also shows the strong international competitiveness of China\'s infrastructure. Previously, the Cambodia De Chong Funan Canal project, in which China participated in the construction, has officially started, and the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed \u200b\u200bRailway and the China-Laos Railway have been operating normally. In the future, the international influence of China\'s infrastructure is expected to be greater, and there may be more projects going overseas.

"China and Vietnam declare to strengthen railway cooperation. On August 20, China and Vietnam issued the """"Joint Statement of the People\'s Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on Further Strengthening Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership and Promoting the Construction of a Community of Shared Future between China and Vietnam"""". It mentioned that China agreed to provide support for Vietnam to formulate plans for the Lang Son-Hanoi, Mong Cai-Ha Long-Haiphong standard-gauge railway projects and feasibility studies for the Lao Cai-Hanoi-Haiphong standard-gauge railway project. The China-Vietnam railway connection has a history of 100 years, but the two countries have different railway gauges. China provides Vietnam with a standard-gauge railway project plan, which will help improve the connection efficiency of the two countries after it is completed in the future. Vietnam\'s active performance in China-Vietnam railway cooperation is not only affected by the factors of unsuccessful cooperation with Japan in the past, but also inseparable from its recognition of China\'s railway technology. The Hanoi Light Rail Project in Vietnam undertaken by China has accumulated a good reputation for China\'s rail transit construction. In June this year, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh met with the chairman of China Railway Signal and Communication Group and expressed the hope that China could support Vietnam in design, construction and technology transfer.",,,,
"The enthusiasm for economic and trade investment between China and Vietnam is expected to increase. The close cooperation between China and Vietnam in the field of infrastructure will promote the interconnection of land transportation between the two sides and is expected to further promote the growth of bilateral trade. China has remained Vietnam\'s largest trading partner for many years, and Vietnam is also China\'s largest trading partner in ASEAN. At the same time, China is the largest market for Vietnam\'s agricultural exports. In July, Vietnam\'s exports of fruits and vegetables to China accounted for 64.2% of all fruit and vegetable exports. In June this year, the Vietnamese government approved the """"2021-2030 Foreign Investment Cooperation Strategy"""", one of the main goals of which is to attract advanced technology and high value-added projects. Vietnam has long relied on labor-intensive industries as its external market advantage, with low technological content and industrial added value. China-Vietnam infrastructure cooperation is expected to further enhance the level of connectivity between traditional products and new technology products.",,,,
"The opening and operation of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed \u200b\u200bRailway and the China-Laos Railway have a strong demonstration effect on China\'s infrastructure going overseas in Southeast Asia. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed \u200b\u200bRailway is the first order of China\'s high-speed railway going overseas with a full system, full elements, and full production chain, and the entire line adopts Chinese technology and standards. As a complex system with technical integration, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed \u200b\u200bRailway not only helps to drive the development of Indonesia\'s railway-related industries, but also has a strong driving force for China\'s exports to Indonesia. In 2022, China\'s exports of railway vehicles, track devices and other products to Indonesia increased by 3.8 times year-on-year, and exports of motor and electrical related products increased by 26.6% year-on-year. The China-Laos Railway is the first transnational electrified railway that is mainly invested and constructed by China, jointly operated and directly connected to the Chinese railway network. In addition to passenger transport, cross-border freight trains on the China-Laos Railway can go directly to logistics distribution centers such as Chengdu and Xi\'an in the north, and connect with the China-Europe Express, and can reach Bangkok, Thailand in the south.

China Road and Bridge Corporation, a subsidiary of China Communications Construction, participated in the construction. The construction period is 4 years and it will be delivered in the form of BOT. After the completion of the canal, it will help improve the logistics efficiency of Cambodia\'s maritime transportation, reduce dependence on cross-border channels, and promote the export of its domestic products. At the same time, the construction of supporting logistics centers in the future will also bring more infrastructure and urbanization needs. From 2022 to 2023, from the source of Cambodia\'s fixed asset investment funds, 79% and 84% of non-domestic funds came from China.

"The overseas expansion of infrastructure is expected to benefit related industries. The opening and operation of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway and the China-Laos railway have a strong demonstration effect on China\'s overseas expansion of infrastructure in Southeast Asia, and will help promote more Southeast Asian countries to cooperate with China in the construction of railways and other infrastructure. For example, China also participated in the investment and construction of the Thailand high-speed railway project, and the China-Myanmar railway has also started construction. The Ministry of Commerce stated in August that from January to July this year, Chinese companies made non-financial direct investments of US$17.94 billion in countries participating in the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, a year-on-year increase of 7.7%; the turnover of contracted projects in countries participating in the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative was US$69.88 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.2%; and the amount of newly signed contracts was US$110.1 billion, a year-on-year increase of 22.3%.

"Policies to stabilize growth have been stepped up again. On October 24, the National People\'s Congress continued to strengthen policies to stabilize growth and decided to issue an additional 1,000 billion yuan in 2023 national debt in the fourth quarter of this year. The deficit rate is expected to increase from 3% to about 3.8%; and authorized the State Council to issue some new local government debt in advance. The increase in quotas and stabilizing growth policies is expected to continue to improve domestic market sentiment. Domestic economic fundamentals have bottomed out and improved: Economic data such as PMI, import and export, and consumption continued to stabilize and improve in September. Financial data in September, government bonds in financing data, and medium and long-term loans to residents and enterprises in RMB loans have all been preliminarily verified. The transmission effect of stable domestic growth. In addition, the government continues to increase policies to stabilize growth.

Recent policies focus on """"activating the capital market"""", """"real estate"""", """"expanding fiscal """" and other aspects have increased policies to stabilize growth, and various cities have successively optimized real estate policies. With the strengthening of domestic signals of stable growth, we are paying attention to the opportunities for improvement in the expected demand for copper, aluminum, steel, PVC, PP, EB and other products.",,,,
"Previously, the A-share market continued to adjust. We believe that the following factors are the main factors: First, the 10-year U.S. bond yield has risen, and the 10Y U.S. bond interest rate has once again exceeded the 5% mark; second, global geopolitical risks have increased, and external uncertainties have rise. Looking to the short term, some of the above factors may continue: On the one hand, the main uncertainty of the continued rise in U.S. bond interest rates is still the risk of the expansion of the U.S. fiscal deficit. Although the interim budget will maintain the normal operation of the government until November 17, the House of Representatives The continued obstruction of the Speaker\'s vote also reflects the huge differences in the government\'s subsequent fiscal direction. And according to the quarterly refinancing plan announced by the Ministry of Finance, the net financing amount of treasury bonds planned in the fourth quarter is 852 billion US dollars, of which the net financing amount of medium and long-term treasury bonds (2 years and above) is 338.55 billion US dollars, which is higher than the 177.97 billion US dollars in the third quarter.

In August 2023, the growth rates of total manufacturing inventories in the United States and China bottomed out and rebounded. Domestic automobiles Under the policy of stabilizing growth in industries such as home furnishings and electronic products, as well as the supply-side policy of gradually shifting from dual control of energy consumption to dual control of carbon emissions, there are opportunities for non-ferrous (copper, aluminum), chemicals (polyester), black building materials and other varieties. . In addition, we are concerned about the recent decline in crude oil prices, but the core still lies in whether the Palestinian-Israeli incident will continue to ferment and the expected impact on crude oil production in the Middle East. At present, geopolitical risks are still relatively high, and we remain optimistic about the subsequent oil prices. .",,,,

Overall, my country\'s major economic indicators weakened marginally in July, and the structural characteristics of """"strong supply and weak demand, strong external demand and weak domestic demand"""" continued. Boosting effective demand is still the core point of economic recovery.

"In October, the manufacturing PMI was 49.5% (previous value was 50.2%, the same below). The non-manufacturing PMI was 50.6% (51.7%), the construction PMI was 53.5% (56.2%), and the service PMI was 50.1% (50.9%).",,,,
Reduction in working days affects the start of work,,,,
The manufacturing PMI fell back in October after rising for four consecutive months.,,,,
Why is the PMI’s upward trend recurring this time?,,,,
"(1) From the perspective of short-term corporate behavior, as the """"Golden Nine and Silver Ten"""" period when construction starts, September is affected by cooler weather and fewer extreme droughts and floods. In most years, the PMI in September is higher than that in October. In other words, there will be a seasonal pullback in October. In addition, the high base that will appear in September is also one of the reasons for the decline.",,,,
"Since 2018, the seasonal decline in PMI in October was 0.53% relative to September. This time, the decline was 0.7%, which is slightly more than seasonal.",,,,
"(2) Judging from the cycle of PMI statistics by the Bureau of Statistics, enterprises submit PMI questionnaires before the 25th of each month. Then, the Bureau of Statistics actually counts enterprise data from the 26th of the previous month to the 25th of the current month. If working days are counted according to this time period, the working days in October 2023 will be three days less than in September. From the perspective of working days in October compared with September since 2018, there are 2.83 fewer working days on average. This is also one of the factors why the month-on-month decline exceeds seasonal",,,,
"(3) In addition, this National Day holiday is connected with the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, forming an 8-day long holiday, which is the longest holiday after the epidemic is relaxed. Residents’ travel demand is relatively strong. Then, some people will use annual leave, asking for leave in advance, etc. to extend their vacation. Even if you ask for leave in advance, it will actually be used for the October PMI statistical cycle starting from September 26.",,,,
"This method lengthens the holiday to a certain extent, which reduces the actual effective working days. From this point of view, the average effective working days in October are fewer, which means the seasonality is weaker than in previous years. The high number of people traveling during National Day can be used as evidence of the reduction in effective working days.",,,,
The long-term economy is still a recovery trend,,,,
"In addition to the above-mentioned seasonal factors, the National Bureau of Statistics also mentioned that """"the foundation for sustained recovery still needs to be further consolidated."""" Most components of the PMI index have declined to varying degrees, which also represents fluctuations in the recovery of the economy. After GDP exceeded 5.2% year-on-year in the first three quarters, there is little actual pressure to achieve the full-year economic growth target in the fourth quarter, and the market itself has low policy expectations. However, at the policy level, the government issued a trillion treasury debt, and the central government increased leverage and increased the intensity of countercyclical adjustments, which also proved its willingness to stabilize the economy.",,,,
"Looking back at previous economic recovery periods, there will be fluctuations during the recovery process, such as the end of 2012 and the second quarter of 2016. But if you take a long-term view, the short-term fluctuations will not change the long-term upward trend. In other words, when the second quarter is already at the bottom of the economic cycle, coupled with the efforts of fiscal, monetary and credit easing, there is a high probability that the economy will rebound from the bottom.",,,,
The logic of the fallback in the construction industry is similar to that of the manufacturing industry,,,,
"The logic of the fall in the construction PMI and the fall in the manufacturing PMI are basically the same, coming from the impact of the start of work and holidays. However, the subsequent one trillion national debts will be implemented, and 500 billion will be used in 2023 and 500 billion in 2024, which will support infrastructure investment in the future. Since the additional issuance of one trillion treasury bonds was announced on October 24, there may not be a significant boost in October’s economic data, but in the rest of the fourth quarter, infrastructure investment may become a support point for the economy. .",,,,
"For the services PMI, the fall in readings is due to the impact of the high base and consumption fronting. In fact, the decline in the service industry PMI is smaller than the seasonal decline. The seasonal decline is 1%, but this time the decline is 0.8%. The service industry performs relatively better.",,,,
The bond market needs to pay attention to the impact on funding,,,,
"Ten-year treasury bonds and treasury bond futures started at the end of August. Along with the recovery of the economy and prices, there has been a wave of weakness. With the subsequent issuance of treasury bonds, we need to pay attention to the impact of fiscal easing on funding interest rates. In addition, if the countercyclical adjustment of infrastructure can accelerate the economic recovery, then we must be cautious about the bond market. Until then, it is recommended to maintain neutral duration.",,,,
Phoenix Insurance Tips: Policy changes exceed expectations: Economic changes exceed expectations,,,,
"Core view: The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a first-quarter economic work conference on April 30. The meeting draft pointed out that """"the economy still faces many challenges as it continues to rebound,"""" reducing the possibility of a sudden withdrawal of policy stimulus. In addition to reaffirming the continued implementation of proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies and emphasizing implementation, we believe that the statement of real estate support policies in the draft is a highlight. We look forward to the government launching more specific measures to digest existing real estate and optimize incremental housing. measure. Against the backdrop of continued policy support, we maintain our full-year economic growth forecast of 4.9% unchanged.",,,,
"The central government does not seem to have relaxed its vigilance in supporting the continued improvement of the economy. Previously, we were worried that economic growth in the first quarter that far exceeded expectations might lead to premature withdrawal of policy stimulus. However, the central government\'s tone on the economic situation at this meeting basically eliminated our worries. The meeting draft pointed out many challenges, including """"effective demand is still insufficient, corporate operating pressure is high, there are many risks and hazards in key areas, the domestic cycle is not smooth enough, and the complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment have increased significantly."""" This is basically consistent with our judgment on China\'s economic situation.",,,,
"The statement of real estate support policies is a highlight of the draft. We expect the government to introduce more specific measures to digest existing real estate and optimize incremental housing. In addition to reiterating that “continue to adhere to city-specific policies, consolidate the responsibilities of local governments, real estate companies, and financial institutions, do a good job in guaranteeing the delivery of housing, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of home buyers... we must seize the opportunity to build a new model of real estate development and promote high-quality development of real estate.” In addition, the meeting called for “taking into account new changes in the supply and demand relationship in the real estate market and the people’s new expectations for high-quality housing, to conduct an overall study on policies and measures to digest existing real estate and optimize incremental housing.” Combined with the fact that although the optimization of demand-side housing purchase policies has been upgraded, housing sales are still sluggish, we believe that this statement means that the government may make more arrangements to digest existing real estate and optimize incremental housing. The specific way to digest the inventory is to promote the """"housing resettlement"""" nationwide in the transformation of urban villages (similar to the previous Guangzhou) and the central bank to provide loans to support the purchase of commercial housing for long-term rental in pilot cities, or to propose more large-scale incremental measures. . We still firmly believe that policy support may be an important factor in helping the real estate industry stabilize while residents\' confidence in home buying has not yet been significantly restored.",,,,
"Fiscal policy will still lead the economic recovery, and stabilizing investment and promoting consumption will remain the two major means of expanding effective demand. On the investment side, consistent with our previous expectations, the government called for “accelerating the issuance and use of special bonds” and required “the early issuance and use of ultra-long-term special government bonds.” The issuance pace of special bonds was slow in the first quarter. Under policy calls, we believe the issuance pace of special bonds and ultra-long-term government bonds may accelerate significantly. Considering that more than 3 trillion yuan of special bonds and 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long-term special government bonds will be issued from the second to the fourth quarter, we expect the growth rate of infrastructure investment to remain stable.",,,,
"On the consumer side, the meeting called for “implementing action plans for large-scale equipment updates and trade-in of consumer goods.” On April 26, the """"Implementation Rules for Automobile Trade-in Subsidies"""" were released.

"The meeting called for continued implementation of prudent monetary policy. In terms of monetary policy, the draft reiterates that """"flexibly use policy tools such as interest rates and deposit reserve ratios to increase support for the real economy and reduce comprehensive social financing costs."""" In our view, this statement does not provide many clues about the future direction of monetary policy. However, based on the previous statements in the People\'s Bank of China\'s regular policy briefing on April 18, we believe that loose monetary policy may become more cautious, depending on the economic recovery and goal achievement (see: Monthly Macro Insights: China Economic growth is better than expected, reducing the possibility of significant stimulus).",,,,
"In terms of industrial policy, the meeting emphasized promoting the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta. As European and American countries continue to put pressure on China\'s overcapacity problem and China and the United States continue to decouple technology, industrial upgrading and improving independent innovation capabilities will be the top priority of industrial policy. In addition, the meeting predicted that the long-awaited Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will be held in July. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held every five years, may make detailed arrangements for reforms in the next five years (Chart 1).",,,,

Industrial added value in October increased by 4.6% year-on-year, 0.1 percentage point higher than the previous month. Taking into account last year\'s low base, the two-year average year-on-year dropped from 5.4% to 4.8%, but this growth rate is still the second highest since the second quarter of this year. Industrial production is mainly driven by the manufacturing industry. In October, the two-year average added value of the manufacturing, mining, and water, electricity and gas supply industries was 3.4%, 5.1%, and 2.7% year-on-year respectively, down 0.5, 0.2, and 1.5 percentage points respectively from the previous month.

Driven by the positive push of the inventory replenishment cycle, the actual slope of demand recovery is not as optimistic as GDP data shows. Economic, financial and price data in October showed that the momentum of endogenous economic recovery needs to be further strengthened. The additional issuance of 1 trillion treasury bonds has released a signal of stable growth, and it is expected that the fiscal year will continue to support the economy in the fourth quarter. There is a high probability that the GDP growth target will be set at 5% in 2024, and more policies to stabilize growth are worth looking forward to.",,,,

"The """"General Principles"""" has also been optimized and adjusted mainly in the following three aspects: First, strengthening personnel and system review requirements. Implement the """"Regulations on the Supervision and Management of Enterprises\' Implementation of Food Safety Subject Responsibilities"""". The """"General Principles"""" clarify that food operating enterprises should be equipped with appropriate food safety management personnel, formulate a food safety risk management and control list, establish and improve daily management and control, weekly inspections, monthly dispatching work systems and Mechanisms, etc.; central kitchens and collective dining distribution units should be equipped with full-time food safety management personnel, and establish a raw material supplier management evaluation system and exit mechanism, etc. The second is to strengthen and refine the """"three preventions"""", especially the review conditions for rodent-proof facilities and equipment.

The refrigeration temperature during transportation of collective dining distribution units has been adjusted from the previous temperature below 10°C to 0°C to 8°C.",,,,
"Judging from the experience of the United States and Japan, the decline in the leverage ratio of interest-rate sensitive non-governmental sectors is more likely to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.",,,,
"From January to May this year, the cumulative increase in social financing scale was 14.8 trillion yuan, 2.52 trillion yuan less than the same period last year. Among them, RMB loans issued to the real economy increased by 10.26 trillion yuan, a decrease of 2.1 trillion yuan year-on-year; net corporate bond financing was 1.2 trillion yuan, 251.9 billion yuan more than the same period last year; net government bond financing was 2.49 trillion yuan, a decrease of 3,497 billion yuan year-on-year. 106 billion yuan; domestic stock financing of non-financial enterprises was 106 billion yuan, 283.5 billion yuan less than the same period last year.",,,,
"At the end of May 2024, the stock of social financing was 391.93 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 8.4%. Looking at the three major sectors of government, enterprises and residents, the stock of government bonds increased by about 14.7% year-on-year, and the growth rate was about 1 percentage point higher than that of the previous month; corporate financing (excluding foreign currency loans) increased by about 8.1% year-on-year, and the growth rate was basically the same as that of the previous month. RMB loans to residents increased by about 4.4% year-on-year, and the growth rate fell by about 0.4 percentage points from the previous month.",,,,
"The main characteristics of recent social financing data are: the growth rate of residents' financing has declined significantly; while the growth rate of government financing has also declined compared with last year, but it still remains at a high level. The growth rate of corporate financing dropped slightly from the previous period, but was relatively stable.",,,,
"From a macro leverage perspective, this will form a transformation of the leverage structure, that is, government leverage replaces non-government sector leverage. Judging from the financial development process of developed economies such as the United States and Japan, the decline in the leverage ratio of the non-governmental sector (or private non-financial sector) is often accompanied by a decline in long-term interest rates. This may be because the debt behavior of the private non-financial sector is more sensitive to interest rates. Therefore, when the willingness of these sectors to take on debt is weak, they may require interest rates to fall more, which is more likely to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.",,,,
"Of course, at present, the financing growth rate of my country's non-financial sector is still higher than the nominal GDP growth rate as a whole, and the growth rate of residents' loans is also close to the nominal GDP growth rate, which means that the residents' leverage ratio is basically stable, so it may not form a sustained impact on long-term interest rates. downward pressure, but it is not advisable to overestimate the upward pressure exerted by the government sector's leverage ratio on long-term interest rates.

"New non-farm payrolls were lower than expected, the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% as expected, and the hourly wage growth rate rebounded to 3.83%: New non-farm payrolls were slightly lower than expected, the unemployment rate was in line with expectations, and the wage growth rate remained resilient, and the recession warning of Sahm\'s law continued to be triggered. In terms of the establishment survey, 114,000 new non-farm payrolls were added in August, lower than the market expectation of 160,000; the new jobs in July and June were revised down by 86,000. The growth rate of non-farm hourly payrolls was better than expected, up 0.40% month-on-month, and the year-on-year growth rate rebounded to 3.83%, and the month-on-month average of March remained at 0.31%. In terms of the household survey, the unemployment rate fell from 4.3% in July to 4.2%, in line with expectations; the labor force participation rate remained at 62.7%. Part-time employment increased while full-time employment decreased, with the cumulative year-on-year growth rate of part-time workers rising to 3.88%, and the cumulative year-on-year growth rate of full-time workers falling to -0.76%.",,,,
"The marginal decline in unemployment rate is mainly due to the reduction of temporary unemployment: After Powell\'s Jackson Hole statement, unemployment rate has become the core data affecting the extent of interest rate cuts. Its decline in August was mainly due to the decline of 163,000 unemployed people to 7.079 million. From the composition point of view, the 0.1% decline in unemployment rate was basically contributed by the decline of temporary unemployment from 1.062 million to 872,000, and the number of permanent unemployed people increased by only 29,000, which still does not meet the precursor of a short-term recession.",,,,
"Why does the Sahm rule fail in the short term? Unemployment includes two categories: """"new entrants and re-entrants to the labor force"""". Their proportion of the total unemployment generally declines before a recession. On the one hand, this is due to a sharp increase in temporary and permanent unemployment. On the other hand, after the economic downturn, the labor supply represented by """"new entrants and re-entrants to the labor force"""" also decreases accordingly, but the demand side declines faster and eventually triggers a recession. The current upward trend in unemployment does not conform to the above law. The proportion of """"new entrants and re-entrants to the labor force"""" in the total unemployed population has not decreased significantly, and the proportion of temporary and permanent unemployment in the total unemployment has not increased significantly as in previous recessions. This is also an important reason why the economy will not enter a recession in the short term even if the Sahm rule is triggered. Although it """"failed"""" in the short term this time, the Sahm rule still reached 0.57% in August and continued to provide recession warnings. We still believe that the NBER """"recession"""" needs to be comprehensively judged based on indicators such as industrial production, consumption of goods and services, real income, and employment; the Sahm rule also failed in September 1969 and October 1976. It is not appropriate to ignore the signals provided by other resilient economic data because of statistical regularity indicators.",,,,
"The weakening of the labor market requires the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates continuously, but a single 50BP is not yet necessary: \u200b\u200bthe process of labor supply exceeding demand is still slow, and the labor market is still difficult to quickly enter recession in the short term, which corresponds to the fact that monetary policy is still mainly """"preventive"""". (1) The new employment of about 100,000 is in a weak state, but it is still significantly different from the negative growth of goods employment and close to zero growth of service employment in the early stages of recession. Secondly, wage growth picked up again month-on-month in August, and working hours also improved marginally, which shows that the weakening of demand is not significant. Judging from changes in the total number of household employment, household employment increased by 168,000 month-on-month in August, which is equivalent to the average non-agricultural employment of about 155,000, which also shows a certain degree of resilience. The Fed has paid more attention to downside risks in the labor market than concerns about inflation, and its weakening indicates the need for three interest rate cuts this year. However, considering that the economy is not prone to recession in the short term, the effectiveness of monetary policy will take longer to prevent the labor market from declining, the Federal Reserve is still guiding expectations of a soft landing, and a single large interest rate cut may trigger market panic, we believe that interest rates should be cut three times in 2024. 25BP each time.",,,,
"The market has strengthened expectations for interest rate cuts, and """"recession trades"""" can still be interspersed: different asset trading directions diverge, U.S. bond yields fell slightly, the U.S. dollar index rebounded, and U.S. stocks fell significantly. CME federal funds rate futures show that traders ultimately still believe that the probability of an interest rate cut at 25 BP in September is higher, but the rate cuts in November and December were both increased to 50 BP, with a total of 125 BP during the year. The yield on U.S. Treasury bonds finally fell slightly, with the two-year bond falling by 9.7 BP to 3.657% and the 10-year bond falling by 2.1 BP to 3.713%, ending the inversion between 2Y and 10Y. The U.S. dollar index rebounded to 101.1830 after falling. The three major U.S. stock indexes collectively fell sharply, with the Nasdaq falling 2.55% to 16690.83 and the S&P 500 falling 1.78% to 5408.42. London gold fell back after rising to close at $2,497.09 per ounce.

"This fiscal and taxation system reform is an in-depth improvement and advancement based on the establishment of a """"modern fiscal and taxation system"""" proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee. The Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee discussed in detail and clearly pointed out that finance is the foundation and important pillar of national governance, and is the institutional guarantee for optimizing resource allocation, maintaining market unity, promoting social equity, and long-term stability of the country, and accordingly proposed budget, tax system, After 11 years of deepening reforms, the modernized fiscal and taxation system has basically taken shape in terms of reform directions in terms of administrative power and expenditure responsibilities. However, there are still some areas that need to be continuously reformed and improved in accordance with the changes in economic and social development patterns. This """"Decision"""" continues the fiscal and taxation reform path of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, and still clarifies the direction of reform in the future from the above three aspects. However, the focus at this stage is different, and the following logical changes need to be focused on.",,,,
"One of the key points is that """"the focus of the adjustment of central-local relations is to increase the financial resources of grassroots localities."""" This meeting focused more on the financial relations between the central and local governments, and part of the tax system reform plan was also included in the paragraph on central-local financial relations. From many aspects, We will implement the policy of “rewarding administrative power and decentralizing financial resources”. Among them, a change that is slightly more than expected is that the statement in the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was deleted from """"maintaining the overall stability of the existing central and local financial resources structure"""" and replaced by """"optimizing the sharing ratio of shared taxes"""", which includes value-added tax, personal income tax, etc. tax, corporate income tax and other stock adjustments. In addition, this meeting also proposed from the perspective of cultivating local tax types: the merger and establishment of local surcharges and the transfer of non-tax revenue management authority as incremental supplements to local tax sources. Finally, the direction of improving the division of powers and the transfer payment system has also moved further from the distribution between the central and local governments to the city and county levels.",,,,
"The second key point is that """"budget reform is a strategic improvement of the fiscal status"""": This """"Decision"""" positions the budget reform on the basis of """"regulating and restraining revenue and expenditure"""" at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, and gives more responsibilities. """"Macro-control function"""", fully integrating state-owned related revenue into budget management is to increase the ability of fiscal policy resource coordination and stock management, and the significance of deepening the zero-based budget reform is to get rid of the """"inertia"""" of fiscal expenditure and strengthen the country\'s major strategic tasks and basic financial protection for people’s livelihood. It is foreseeable that the importance of fiscal policy in the macroeconomics will increase significantly in the coming period.",,,,
"The third key point is that """"tax system reform focuses on structural optimization"""": the main function of taxation is not only to raise revenue, but also has important regulatory functions such as resource allocation and income distribution. With the major changes in economic and social development, the logic of this reform is based on stabilizing the income function. In the future, it is necessary to give more play to the resource allocation and income distribution functions. For example: in response to the clarification of low-carbon goals and the development of the digital economy, it is necessary to study a tax system that is suitable for new business forms; in response to the aging of the population and the widening gap between rich and poor, it is necessary to structurally optimize existing tax revenues; in response to the non-cyclical imbalance of supply and demand To solve the problem, the incentive mechanism for local governments needs to be adjusted from a tax perspective; in order to address the imbalance of financial resources between the central and local governments, it is necessary to consider optimizing the sharing ratio of shared taxes.",,,,
Central-local relations: The focus is to increase local financial resources at the grassroots level:,,,,
"(1) Take multiple measures to increase local financial resources: First, the local consumption tax is now a """"brand"""", and how to promote it is the key. We believe that pilot projects for tax sub-categories may be advanced in the future, and the tax collection and administration efficiency after the reform will also need to be taken into consideration. For example, jewelry and jade, gold and silver jewelry, automobiles, and alcohol are more likely to be promoted first; second, local surcharges are established in a consolidated manner and local governments are authorized to determine specific applicable tax rates within a certain range. This part of the content was proposed for the first time at this meeting. It is relatively unexpected incremental information. Since the tax bases of the three taxes and fees are the same and they are mainly local taxes, the combined management will help improve tax collection efficiency and gradually cultivate local main tax types. The third is to lower the management authority of non-tax revenue and cultivate local tax sources. At present, my country\'s non-tax revenue accounts for a large proportion mainly from the use of state-owned resources. Because local governments have more information advantages, they can formulate more realistic non-tax revenue policies based on the region\'s economic development level and resource endowments, and gradually cultivate local tax sources in non-tax revenue that are suitable for each place.",,,,
"(2) The division of administrative powers and transfer of payments focus on """"moving administrative powers upward and sinking financial resources"""": First, deepen the division of administrative powers and expenditure responsibilities below the provincial level. At present, the division of power and expenditure responsibilities between the central and provincial levels is relatively clear. Among the 21 categories of fiscal support subjects, 11 categories of implementation plans have been issued, and the divided expenditures account for 44% of the total expenditures. However, the progress of division at the provincial level is still not as good as the progress of division between central and local governments, which is also the main direction of reform in the future. Second, in terms of transfer payments, the emphasis is on taking into account both """"money goes with people"""" and """"guaranteeing grassroots financial resources."""" At present, my country\'s special transfer payments still account for a large proportion of infrastructure expenditures, and general transfer payments mainly include joint power payments and balancing payments. We believe that the “clean-up and standardization of special transfer payments and increase of general transfer payments” proposed at this meeting is mainly to reduce the proportion of infrastructure expenditures in special transfer payments, and correspondingly increase the transfer payment and balance of common powers in general transfer payments. Transfer Payment.",,,,
"(3) Avoid supporting fund arrangements where “the central government orders food and local governments pay the bill”: “No violations of regulations are allowed to require local governments to arrange supporting funds” is an important institutional guarantee to reduce basic pressure and prevent debt risks. Under our country’s management framework of “everything adds up, everything is fast”, government departments at all levels are not only led by local governments at the same level, but also under the business guidance of vertical departments. Policies issued by the central government ultimately need to be implemented at the grassroots level. In recent years, local assessment objectives have shifted from single economic growth to multi-objective governance, and the phenomenon of """"the central government orders food and local governments pay the bill"""" has intensified. Secondly, most policies are basically introduced after the local and central fiscal budget drafts are released. For capital expenditures that are not included in the current year\'s budget, grassroots governments often need to use extra-budgetary funds. This is also one of the reasons why local government expenditures have continued to increase and debt risks have continued to accumulate in the past.",,,,
Budget reform: budget reform strategically improves fiscal status,,,,
"(1) Comprehensive inclusion in budget management and improvement of fiscal macro-control capabilities: This meeting proposed the need to “strengthen financial resources and budget coordination, and incorporate all revenue obtained by relying on administrative power, government credit, and state-owned resources and assets into government budget management.” Among them, It mainly includes a large number of state-owned enterprises that are not included in budget management, mainly referring to enterprises under the management of state-owned enterprises by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the Ministry of Finance and other ministries and commissions. This meeting also proposed “improving the state-owned capital operation budget and performance evaluation system, strengthening the country’s major strategic tasks and basic people’s livelihood financial resources”, which means that with the comprehensive integration of state-owned enterprises into budget management in the future, the income and expenditure scale of the “three ledgers” will increase in the future. It is expected to increase significantly, effectively supplement fiscal revenue, and strengthen fiscal macro-control and the ability to serve the country\'s major strategies from both revenue growth and structural adjustment.",,,,
"(2) Deepen the reform of zero-based budgeting and break the """"inertia"""" of expenditures: Due to the current fiscal budget preparation method of """"only increasing but not decreasing, only moving increases but not stocks"""", it is difficult for financial resources to flow to areas where there is real demand. Therefore, budget reform is the """"key"""" to solve the problem of fixed expenditures. The so-called zero-based budget means that all budget expenditures are reset to zero when preparing the budget. According to the new development direction, previously unnecessary fiscal expenditure items are eliminated and the budget is rearranged. Revenue and expenditure are an important guarantee for enhancing macro-control capabilities.",,,,
Tax reform: Keeping the tax burden stable while focusing on structural optimization,,,,
"(1) Study the tax system corresponding to the new business format: We believe that the so-called tax system related to the new business format refers to the corresponding adjustment of the existing tax system according to the new business format, such as the """"improving comprehensive and comprehensive tax system"""" mentioned again this time. A personal income tax system that combines classifications.” On the other hand, it refers to studying the establishment of new taxes that are suitable for economic industries, such as digital service tax. Judging from international experience, with the development of the global digital economy, countries or regions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, and Singapore have gradually incorporated digital service tax into practice and formulated corresponding tax systems and bills.",,,,
"(2) Value-added tax reform needs to improve the excess tax refund mechanism on the basis of stabilizing the tax burden: The current value-added tax reform is still in the stage of continuous deepening and improvement since 2017. The current tax system has been basically mature and finalized. Legislation has also been promoted in recent years and will be implemented this year. It will enter the """"third review"""" at the end of the year. This meeting described it as """"improving the VAT refund policy and deduction chain"""". As judged in our previous report """"Improving the Two Main Lines of VAT"""", the focus in the future is to improve the sharing mechanism of the VAT refund. , the possibility of further """"merging tax files"""" is low.",,,,
"(3) The comprehensive promotion of the reform of water resources fees and taxes means that regulation is more important than revenue: The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China mentioned in the improvement of the ecological environment governance system that """"implement the rigid restriction system of water resources and comprehensively implement the reform of water resources fees and taxes."""" We believe that the combination The preliminary pilot work of the water resources tax has been relatively complete, and the basis for full implementation is now in place. The main purpose of the reform is to give full play to the regulatory role of tax leverage and curb irrational water use. The regulatory significance of comprehensively promoting fee-to-tax reform is greater than its supplementary significance to local revenue. At present, the water resources tax revenue in the nine pilot areas is 23.6 billion yuan, among which Shanxi, Shandong, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia have higher revenue.",,,,
"(4) Optimizing the sharing ratio of shared tax: What is slightly more than expected this time is the proposal to """"optimize the sharing ratio of shared tax"""". At present, my country\'s shared tax mainly includes value-added tax, corporate income tax, personal income tax, and resource tax. Among them, resource tax is currently mainly attributed to For local governments, the central-local share ratio of corporate income tax and personal income tax is """"6:4"""", and the share ratio of value-added tax is """"5:5"""". We believe that adjustments to the sharing ratio in the future may be mainly for corporate income tax, personal income tax, and value-added tax. Calculated based on a 10% adjustment, the local revenue supplements will be 438.7 billion yuan, 151.4 billion yuan, and 679.2 billion yuan respectively.",,,,
"(5) Improve the real estate tax system: This meeting regards the development of the real estate industry as an integral part of improving the social security system, and in the """"Decision"""", while proposing to meet and support the diversified and improved housing needs of urban and rural residents, it mentions """"improving the real estate tax system"""". Tax System"""". We believe that the real estate tax system mentioned at this meeting is not """"accelerating real estate tax legislation and promoting reform in a timely manner"""" mentioned in the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee. The main thing is to ensure that the """"five real estate taxes"""" for display housing can adapt to market changes and reduce the tax burden in the development and transaction links.",,,,

"Event: On December 9, the National Bureau of Statistics released price data for November. The data showed that the CPI in November recorded -0.5% year-on-year, the expected value was -0.1%, the previous value was -0.2%, and the month-on-month CPI recorded -0.5%, the previous value -0.1%. In November, PPI recorded -3.0% year-on-year, the expected value was -2.8%, the previous value was -2.6%, the month-on-month value was -0.3%, and the previous value was 0.0%.",,,,
"The CPI continued to be sluggish in November, recording -0.5% both year-on-year and month-on-month, which was significantly lower than the seasonality. The significant month-on-month weakening was mainly due to the sufficient supply of agricultural products due to warmer weather, the decline in international oil prices, and the fall in consumer demand for travel and other services. In the food sub-category, fresh vegetables, pork and eggs are the main drag items. Among them, the price of pigs fell sharply in November, recording -3.0%, which was significantly lower than the 1.64% in the same period in history. The number of live pigs sold has increased recently. In addition, Warmer weather has delayed the demand for preserved meat in some areas, and pork prices have fallen super-seasonally. Considering that the profits of some pig factories are limited, the number of fertile sows has declined significantly year-on-year recently, and the subsequent decline in pig prices may be relatively limited.",,,,
"In the non-food sub-category, energy is still the main drag factor. The decline in oil prices in November drove the fuel CPI to fall super-seasonally from the previous month. Among them, fuel for transportation recorded -2.7% from the previous month, which was significantly lower than the historical average of 0.54% for the same period. Affected by the decline in international oil prices, domestic gasoline prices have dropped significantly, affecting the CPI to fall by about 0.10 percentage points. The recent international crude oil market has been dominated by sluggish demand. Since late October, oil prices have continued to fall by more than 20%, and market sentiment is bearish. It is still necessary to further observe the implementation of OPEC+\'s """"voluntary production reduction"""" in the future.",,,,

The difference between the month-on-month average core CPI from January to November 2023 and the same period in 2022 has further narrowed, and is even gradually approaching the 2020 level. From a sub-item perspective, as residents travel into the off-season, tourism prices have become a major drag, recording -5.9% month-on-month, which is significantly lower than seasonal. Core commodities excluding services weakened again month-on-month. Among them, durable consumer goods such as communication tools and home appliances were still the main drag. They weakened super-seasonally month-on-month, recording -1.8% and -1.1% respectively, which may reflect residents\' expectations for future income and Employment confidence remains low.",,,,
"In November, PPI recorded -3% year-on-year. After weakening in October, it fell again year-on-year and recorded -0.3% month-on-month, turning negative again. This was mainly affected by factors such as the fall in international oil prices and weak market demand for some industrial products. Looking at specific industries, the upstream oil and gas extraction, fuel processing, chemical fiber manufacturing and chemical products prices that are greatly affected by crude oil have seen the largest month-on-month price declines. However, the demand for coal and natural gas increased seasonally in November. At the same time, with the advancement of infrastructure projects, iron and steel prices have increased since November. Ore and rebar prices continued to recover, with black mining and processing, gas production and black smelting processing leading to the highest month-on-month PPI increases.",,,,
"Looking forward, the current CPI and PPI continue to be sluggish in the bottom range, and the double drag of lard resonance may be a short-term disturbance. However, the core CPI month-on-month trend shows that overall domestic demand is still sluggish, and we still need to look forward to further efforts from the policy side.",,,,

On the other hand, budget supervision should be intensified, and departmental budget and final account preparation, budget execution, asset management, budget performance management, etc. should be organically integrated to firmly consolidate the responsibilities of internal management entities of budget units, strengthen rigid constraints on budget management throughout the chain, and effectively improve The level of closed-loop management of the entire budget chain.",,,,
"Market Enlightenment: Economic performance is stable, continuing the view that interest rates will fluctuate in the medium term. Among the October economic data, consumption was stable and stronger than expected, investment fell and was weaker than expected, and industrial growth rebounded and was stronger than expected. Overall, the information displayed by the manufacturing PMI at the beginning of the month is relatively consistent, showing that although terminal demand has fluctuated slightly, the start of the inventory cycle has improved the economy's ability to withstand fluctuations. It is worth noting that real estate sales, funding sources, and investments all slowed down in October. Therefore, in the medium term, there is a high probability that the economy will recover after twists and turns and will not enter negative feedback. For bonds, the marginal advantage is that the U.S. economy is slowing down and U.S. bond yields have fallen; substantial and sustained improvement in the domestic economy still needs to wait; monetary policy in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year will most likely focus on stabilizing growth. The marginal downside is the easing of Sino-U.S. relations and the mid- to long-term rebalancing of monetary and fiscal policy. Taken together, the view that interest rates remain volatile in the medium term continues.",,,,
"In October, social retail sales increased by 7.6% year-on-year, higher than the previous value and expected value, mainly supported by the low base in the same period last year. Looking at the two-year average, it remains basically stable. First, service and travel consumption performed generally this month. Second, the decline in consumption related to the real estate chain narrowed. Third, consumption of daily necessities has been stable this month after rising sharply last month. Fourth, the performance of upgraded consumption was stable, and the margins of some commodities improved.",,,,
"The growth rates of real estate investment and commercial housing sales have slowed down, and the decline in new construction starts has narrowed for three consecutive months. In October, the cumulative decline rate of real estate development investment completion and commercial housing sales area slowed down; the cumulative decline in newly started construction area narrowed; the cumulative growth rate of housing completion area remained at a high level; the decline rate of real estate development funding sources also slowed down.",,,,
"The growth rate of infrastructure investment has declined due to seasonal reasons. In October, infrastructure investment increased by 5.9% year-on-year, 0.3 percentage points lower than in September, and the two-year average growth rate was 7.3% (previous value was 7.4%). With the gradual improvement in financial guarantee and project support, the growth of infrastructure investment in the next stage is expected to remain stable.",,,,
"The growth rate of manufacturing investment remained unchanged from the previous month, and the decline in private investment narrowed. The cumulative growth rate of manufacturing investment in October was 6.2% (previous value was 6.2%). Private investment accumulated year-on-year -0.5% (previous value -0.6%), and the decline narrowed for two consecutive months. In terms of industries, benefiting from the steady recovery of consumption, the investment growth rate of some consumer goods manufacturing industries picked up this month; investment in chemical raw materials and chemical products manufacturing industry was relatively resilient; the cumulative growth rate of non-ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry was stable. Investment performance in most equipment manufacturing industries was stable.",,,,
"Industrial production is recovering well. In October, the added value of industrial enterprises above designated size increased by 4.6% year-on-year (previous value: 4.5%), and the two-year average growth rate was 4.8% (previous value: 5.4%). The production and sales ratio of industrial enterprises in October was 97.4%, which has remained at this level since August. The performance of the consumer goods industry was basically stable. The performance of the industrial products manufacturing industry is divided. The added value of the equipment manufacturing industry increased by 6.2% year-on-year, 0.7 percentage points faster than the previous month, and has rebounded for three consecutive months. The equipment manufacturing industry represented by automobile manufacturing and electrical machinery has a relatively obvious driving role.",,,,

"Hot Observation 1: Uncertainty about “Trump’s policies” exacerbates market volatility. Market volatility has increased significantly due to Trump\'s own uncertainty and the magnitude of his policy changes. The S&P 500 Volatility Index began to soar rapidly after the interview, rising to 16.52 on July 19, an increase of 25.2% from July 16. We believe that in terms of China policy, considering high tariffs and the """"America First"""" economic policy may have a certain impact on our country. On the one hand, it may impact my country\'s foreign trade; on the other hand, the so-called """"de-Sinicization"""" may intensify. In addition, Trump\'s policies may bring """"reflation"""" risks. First, in terms of fiscal and tariff policies, Trump only mentioned increasing tariffs and reducing corporate taxes on the supply side, but did not provide matching fiscal tightening on the spending side. The second is the tightening of immigration laws and the largest deportation plan in U.S. history, which will lead to an expansion of the labor gap in the low-end service industry in the United States and increase wage growth and inflationary pressures. Third, in terms of trade policy, in order to reduce the trade deficit, Trump may impose a 10% tariff on all goods, which may increase the price of imported goods, thus raising inflation.",,,,
"Hot Observation 2: In 2024, the first third-level subsidiary of a central enterprise from Beijing to move to Xiongan will be officially settled. This marks the further advancement of """"liberating Beijing\'s non-capital functions"""".

Increase the speed of expansion and optimize the industrial structure and regional layout of central enterprises to cultivate industrial clusters; secondly, from the perspective of the relocated location, it will help improve the local resource utilization efficiency of the relocated location; thirdly, from the perspective of the capital market, the relocation of central enterprises will help Yu plays a backbone role in improving the new national system by virtue of its relative financing cost advantage.",,,,
"Hot Observation 3: What do you think of the possible reduction in the predetermined interest rates of insurance products? We believe that this indicates that the subsequent decline in insurance liability-side costs may increase insurance funds\' tolerance for downward asset-side yields. The possible reduction in the predetermined interest rate means that the rate of return of insurance as an asset will decrease, and it also means that the insurance company\'s liability-side costs will decrease. The decrease in liability-side costs may also cause the insurance company\'s lower limit requirement for the asset-side rate of return to move downwards. The pressure of """"interest rate loss"""" began to gradually appear. Changes in the liability-side costs of insurance companies are mainly determined by predetermined interest rates. Our calculations show that since 2021, the capital costs of insurance companies have continued to rise, while the total return on investment has begun to decline, resulting in a rapid decline in interest spreads, to the interest rate spread in the second half of 2023 has become negative, resulting in """"interest loss"""". Considering the rapid decline in interest rate bond and credit bond yields in the first half of 2024, spread losses may further expand.",,,,
"High frequency macro data. We conducted high-frequency analysis from ten major dimensions and mapped it to nine major industries. High-frequency data continues to support the improvement of the prosperity of transportation, coal and steel, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, non-ferrous metals, cultural tourism consumption and construction and building materials. repair. In terms of industry, some coal mines in main production areas that were suspended due to security inspections during the meeting have begun to resume production, and there is some resistance to the upward trend in coking coal and coke prices. It is expected that oil prices will mainly fluctuate under the uncertainty of the U.S. election and interest rate cuts next week. According to China Steel Network’s research, inventory pressure at Tangshan Steel Plant still exists. Due to the impact of low profits, we judge that the blast furnace operating rate may continue to decline in late July. Overall, it is expected that industrial production will still show a mismatch between supply and demand in late July due to the impact of high temperatures in the north, rainfall in the south, and the sudden turn of drought and floods in some areas. In terms of consumption, the high-frequency and high-intensity promotions of car companies in the first half of the year have disturbed the normal price trend of the car market. Therefore, it is expected that the average daily sales volume of passenger cars will fluctuate at a low level in July, and sales may pick up after terminal prices are restored. situation. It is expected that consumption will pick up marginally due to the strength of summer movies in late July, but it still needs to wait for the support of improvement in residents\' income expectations. In terms of real estate, the transaction area of \u200b\u200bcommercial housing is still in the downward range year-on-month, and the listing of second-hand houses also continues to decline year-on-month. This is mainly due to the mid-year sprint season of real estate companies. The pace of launches has accelerated, discounts have increased, and sales have reached the high point of the year. It is expected to be in late July. Commercial housing transactions may continue to decline. In terms of infrastructure, special bonds are slow and weather disturbances are added, and infrastructure is relatively weak. In terms of foreign trade, affected by the geopolitical situation, ship detours have supported the rise in freight rates, and container shipping prices are still in a strong upward range. In terms of transportation, it is expected that the popularity of transportation will increase due to the impact of the summer vacation in late July. In terms of prices, it is expected that egg and pig prices will continue to rise in July. The rise in egg prices may be affected by the increase in chicken prices on the supply side and insufficient supply during the Spring Festival → the supply of raw chickens is low → the lack of increase in the number of laying hens. The demand side is affected by the previous Low egg prices → Strong enthusiasm for bargain hunting in the market → Increased stocking in downstream markets → Boosting bullish sentiment in the market. Secondly, it was affected by continued rainfall in the south → Rising vegetable prices → Stronger willingness of residents to substitute eggs for consumption. The rise in pig prices is mainly due to the accelerated reduction in supply + secondary fattening + high-temperature and high-density breeding + active elimination of pig companies with high debts, which is the core support. In terms of commodities, Nanhua\'s main price index has mostly increased year-on-year and declined month-on-month. It is expected that oil prices may continue to rise in late July, mainly due to the further widening of the gap between supply and demand due to production cuts. In the future, we need to pay attention to the arrival of the peak self-driving season in the United States and geopolitical tensions. Political changes.",,,,
"Investment suggestions: 1) Asset allocation in the second half of the year: In the second half of the year, the focus is on stability while making progress: In terms of stocks, U.S. dollar assets are likely to remain strong. In the domestic part, transactional opportunities focus on technological growth, and allocative opportunities focus on dividends, agricultural products, energy resources, and export overseas. In terms of bonds, the 10-year Treasury bond has been volatile in the short term, and yields still have downward momentum in the fourth quarter. In terms of commodities, focus on varieties with """"high certainty of supply contraction + overseas demand pricing"""". In terms of gold, in the short term, it may benefit from the expectation of loose liquidity and the gold purchase behavior of the central bank\'s reserve diversification.

Risk warning: policy support is less than expected; policy implementation is less than expected; economic recovery process is less than expected,,,,
"Event: According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in May 2024, China\'s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 49.5%, lower than 50.4% last month; in May, the non-manufacturing business activity index was 51.1%, a low Compared with 51.2% last month, the construction PMI index was 54.4%, lower than 56.3% last month, and the service PMI index was 50.5%, higher than 50.3% last month.",,,,
The key points of May PMI data are as follows:,,,,
"Mainly due to the shift in market demand from expansion to contraction and the sharp decline in the production index, the official manufacturing PMI index in May fell 0.9 percentage points from the previous month to 49.5%, returning to the balance between prosperity and contraction after two months. Down. This shows that in the context of continued adjustments in the real estate industry, the foundation for macroeconomic recovery is not yet solid, and policies to stabilize growth need to be further developed. At present, we must first focus on solving the problem of insufficient effective demand. It can be seen that the new orders index dropped to 49.6% in May from 51.1% in the previous month, a sharp drop of 1.5 percentage points, and dropped to the contraction range. In addition to the need for further measures to promote consumption such as the trade-in of durable consumer goods, the main reason is that the current consumption demand is not strong due to factors such as the slowdown in the income growth of urban residents in the early stage and the downturn in the property market that has dragged down residents\' consumer confidence. According to data from the China Logistics Information Center, more than 60% of manufacturing companies reported insufficient market demand in May, which is obviously at a high level. This means that weak demand is the main contradiction restricting macroeconomic operation at this stage.",,,,
"It is worth noting that the new export orders index fell sharply by 2.3 percentage points to 48.3% in May, which was also significantly lower than expected. This is contrary to the sharp rise in the US S&P Manufacturing PMI to 50.9% in May, and the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI Index which has been in the expansion range for four consecutive months as of April. However, this also shows that in the context of weak global economic growth this year, the rebound in international trade needs to be further observed, and the role of external demand in driving the macroeconomy should not be overestimated.",,,,
"The production index dropped sharply by 2.1 percentage points to 50.8% in May, but continued to be in the expansion range. The production index dropped significantly in May, mainly due to insufficient domestic demand; if it can continue to remain in the expansion range, it is due to the current strong external demand, companies digesting the backlog of orders in the early stage (the order on hand index fell by 0.3 percentage points in May), and the beginning of the year It is related to factors such as infrastructure and manufacturing investment maintaining rapid growth. It should be pointed out that the production index and new orders index in May were in the expansion range and contraction range respectively, indicating that the macroeconomic situation of """"strong supply and weak demand"""" has become more prominent, which will also restrict the momentum of price recovery in the later period.",,,,
"In terms of other sub-indexes that the market is more concerned about, the two price indexes in the manufacturing PMI in May rose sharply across the board. Among them, the ex-factory price index increased by 1.3 percentage points to 50.4%, and the purchase price index of major raw materials increased significantly by 2.9 percentage points to 56.9%. This corroborates the recent rise in prices of domestically-led commodities such as steel, cement, and coal, which is mainly driven by production capacity compression. We judge that the PPI in May will also turn from a decrease to an increase month-on-month, and the year-on-year decrease will be significantly narrowed. It should be pointed out that although the ex-factory price index in May returned to the expansion range after 7 months, the difference with the main raw material purchase price index is widening, which will put some pressure on the profits of the mid- and downstream manufacturing industries in the future.",,,,
"The trend of the PMI index for large, medium and small enterprises in May was divergent. Among them, the PMI of large enterprises rose by 0.4 percentage points to 50.7%, while the PMI indexes of medium and small enterprises fell by 1.3 and 3.6 percentage points respectively, both falling below the balance between prosperity and contraction. The PMI of large enterprises is in the prosperous range, which is mainly related to the current high level of infrastructure investment, and infrastructure projects are mainly participated by large enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises are often more closely connected with the consumer market, and the decline in market demand has a more obvious impact on them. Since small enterprises are the main force in absorbing urban employment, if their prosperity continues to be low, it may have a greater impact on urban employment data in the future. We judge that financial support and tax and fee reduction policies for small and micro enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households are likely to be further increased.",,,,
"The main highlight of the May manufacturing PMI data is that although the production and operating activity expectations index fell by 0.9 percentage points, it continues to be at a high level of 54.3%. This shows that under the background of macro policies that maintain a steady growth orientation, the intensive implementation of new real estate policies on May 17, and policies that are promoting large-scale equipment updates and the replacement of old consumer durables with new ones, companies have strong confidence in future production and operations.",,,,
"The PMI index of the service industry in May was 50.5%, an improvement of 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. This was first driven by the release of demand during the May Day holiday. The prosperity levels of scenic area services, culture, sports and entertainment, air transportation and other industries increased significantly that month. At the same time, the recent PMI of the service industry has continued to be better than that of the manufacturing industry, which is also related to the current gradual shift of residents\' consumption focus to service consumption, indicating that the overall trend of consumption transfer and upgrading is still continuing.",,,,
"The business activity index of the construction industry in May was 54.4%, a sharp decrease of 1.9 percentage points from the previous month. Among them, the prosperity of the civil engineering and construction industry, which is closely related to infrastructure investment, has also declined, but it is still at a high level of more than 58%. On the one hand, this means that due to the slow pace of local government bond issuance since the beginning of the year, the growth rate of infrastructure investment may slow down in the short term. On the other hand, it also shows that infrastructure investment will remain at a high level in the future. This will largely offset the impact of the decline in real estate investment and provide support for the rapid growth of construction industry activity.",,,,
"Overall, mainly due to weak domestic demand and marginal slowdown in external demand, the manufacturing PMI index fell back to the contraction range in May, which was lower than market expectations. At the same time, the prosperity of the construction industry has also declined. This shows that against the backdrop of continued adjustments in the real estate industry, the current economic recovery is not yet solidly based, with insufficient effective demand being the main contradiction.",,,,
"Looking forward, the manufacturing PMI index in June is likely to continue to be in the contraction range, but the extent of contraction may be moderated. On the one hand, the global manufacturing industry is expected to maintain an upward momentum in the short term, and external demand will continue to have a positive impact on the domestic manufacturing industry; on the other hand, the issuance of ultra-long-term special government bonds began in May, and the issuance of special bonds has also accelerated significantly. In addition, Large-scale equipment renewal and durable consumer goods trade-in policies are fully implemented, and under the influence of promoting the development of new productivity and the comprehensive advancement of the """"three major projects"""", manufacturing investment and infrastructure investment will maintain a rapid growth level, all of which will have an impact on manufacturing The supply and demand sides of the industry have a certain pulling effect. However, we need to pay close attention to the impact of the trend of the real estate industry on the overall manufacturing boom level. This is also the reason why we judge that the manufacturing PMI index in June will continue to be below the balance line of prosperity and contraction.",,,,
"We believe that boosting the manufacturing industry in the later period should mainly focus on the following three aspects: First, after the new property market policies are introduced on May 17, the next key is the intensity of implementation, in which a rapid reduction in residential mortgage interest rates is particularly important. This is the key to reversing market expectations and promoting the stabilization and recovery of the property market. Second, after a period of observation, macroeconomic policies in the third quarter are expected to further intensify in the direction of stabilizing growth, including moderately accelerating credit extension, further accelerating government bond issuance, and effectively implementing a series of previously introduced measures to expand investment and promote consumption. , to hedge against the impact of the downturn in the real estate industry. We judge that interest rate cuts and reserve requirement ratio cuts in the third quarter are all within the policy toolbox. The third is to deepen reforms in key areas and create a stable, transparent and predictable policy environment. This year, all localities must implement the """"31 Measures to Promote the Development and Growth of the Private Economy"""" issued last year. This is an effective measure to enhance the endogenous growth momentum of the manufacturing industry with private enterprises as the main body.",,,,
"Seeking truth from facts is the essence of Marxism and an important thinking method for us Communists. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that leading cadres at all levels should implement seeking truth from facts into the entire process of leadership work and consciously set an example by adhering to seeking truth from facts. This requires leading cadres to consciously strengthen their belief in seeking truth from facts, enhance their ability to seek truth from facts, and keep it in mind and put it into practice at all times and everywhere.",,,,
"Seeking truth from facts is Mao Zedong’s high-level summary of the Marxist worldview and methodology using Chinese idioms.

After the Yan\'an Rectification Movement and the Seventh Party Congress, seeking truth from facts has become an important part of our party\'s ideological line, which has been supported and implemented by the entire party and has been widely implemented among the people. Looking back on the party\'s history, whether we can seek truth from facts is the key to the success or failure of our party and country\'s work. It is precisely because of our insistence on seeking truth from facts that the Chinese nation has made a great leap from standing up, getting rich, and becoming strong.",,,,
"Seeking truth from facts is so important, why do some leading cadres often deviate from the requirement of seeking truth from facts in practice? On the one hand, objective reality is complex and ever-changing, and the laws hidden behind the phenomena are not easy to grasp. Marx pointed out that if the manifestation of things and the essence of things were directly integrated into one, all science would become superfluous. The process of understanding the nature of objective things is difficult. It is difficult to truly find the laws without hard work, hard work and sweat. On the other hand, even if objective laws are obtained, due to low party consciousness and selfish thoughts, they will not tell the truth, do practical things, and not seek practical results. Seeking truth from facts is the greatest Party spirit. When leading cadres think about problems, make decisions, and do things, they must proceed from reality and serve the people.",,,,
"General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: """"All our achievements in the past were based on seeking truth from facts. Today, if we want to continue to push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must still rely on seeking truth from facts.""""

Face the situation and tasks we face, face the complex and ever-changing contradictions and problems on the road of reform, implement seeking truth from facts into the entire work process, and constantly improve our ideological and theoretical level and work level.",,,,
"Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are an organic unity, and the purpose of emancipating the mind is to better seek truth from facts. Without a foundation in scientific theory and a scientific worldview and methodology, we cannot see the essence of things through their phenomena, and we cannot grasp the internal connections of things. We will easily fall into blindness, one-sidedness, and passivity, and it will be difficult to seek truth from facts. At the same time, ideological understanding must conform to objective reality, break through the shackles of backward traditional concepts and subjective prejudices, and change the mental state of being conservative and not accepting new things. Leading cadres must have a solid foundation in Marxist theory, firmly grasp the ideological weapons to understand the world and objective laws, and be good at using Marxist positions, viewpoints, and methods to continuously analyze and solve new problems we face.",,,,
"The prerequisite for adhering to seeking truth from facts is to go deep into reality, understand reality, and conduct investigation and research. Investigation and research are the basis for planning and the way to achieve things, and are the heirloom of our party; without investigation, there will be no right to speak and no right to make decisions. Leading cadres must practice the basic skills of investigation and research, adhere to problem orientation, face contradictory issues, go deep into reality, go deep into the grassroots, and go deep into the masses, get down to do practical things, plan practical strategies, seek practical results, and understand and grasp the changing world situation and National conditions and party conditions, and find ways to solve work problems.",,,,

"In November, the rapid decline in U.S. bond interest rates was the most distinctive theme in overseas markets. As of November 30, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 51bp to 4.37%. The sharp fall in U.S. bond yields has affected the """"pricing"""" of various assets: 1) The U.S. dollar index rapidly depreciated 3.0% to 103.5; 2) Most equity assets rose, with developed markets and emerging markets excluding China rising by 9.2% and 10.3 respectively. %; 3) Benefiting from the fall in real interest rates, gold prices rose another 2.7%, approaching a record high. The rapid fall in U.S. bond interest rates was driven by three factors: the easing of the contradiction between supply and demand, weakening economic data, and easing of speculative disturbances. First, the Ministry of Finance expects net bond issuance of US$776 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of US$76 billion from expected; the indirect purchase rate of the 20Y US bond auction is 74%, and overseas demand has picked up. Second, the economy is weakening and the Federal Reserve is dovish; market expectations for an interest rate cut in Q1 next year have risen from 15% to 60%. Third, speculative disturbances have eased, and non-commercial short positions in U.S. debt have decreased by 18% in a single month.",,,,
"2. What will be the focus of the domestic market in November? The RMB exchange rate has appreciated significantly, but other market reactions have been relatively muted",,,,
"The sharp appreciation of the RMB exchange rate is undoubtedly the focus of the domestic market in November, but the strengthening exchange rate has relatively limited support for the equity market. The RMB appreciated significantly in November, with the offshore RMB rising from 7.34 to 7.14. However, funds from Beijing continued to flow out, with a total outflow of 1.78 billion yuan in November. The higher the shareholding proportion of funds from Beijing, the worse the average market performance in November. The reasons for the divergence between stocks and exchange rates may lie in the twists and turns of fundamental recovery and low expectations of monetary easing. Under the overall low market sentiment, """"policy expectations"""" have become one of the market trading clues this month. In November, the A-share sentiment index dropped from 24.3 to 23.7. In the relatively sluggish market environment, the structural market conditions under """"policy expectations"""" were more significant: 1) With the continued increase in real estate policies, Shanghai copper and rebar rose by 1.4% respectively. , 4.7%, real estate stocks also rose sharply in stages. 2) Stimulated by favorable factors such as the expansion of the Beijing Stock Exchange, the North Securities 50 stands out, achieving an excess return of 27% compared to Wind Quan A.",,,,
"3. How will the market perform in December? Overseas, be wary of the drag on fundamentals, while domestic attention should be paid to the opportunities of “changes” in the market",,,,
"In overseas markets, the decline in U.S. bond yields may come to an end, and the continuation of the downward trend in the molecule may become a """"new variable"""" that the market focuses on. In December, market expectations for interest rate cuts were easy to fall but difficult to rise, and term spreads also restricted the downward space for U.S. bond interest rates. Against the backdrop of shocks on the denominator side, the market may be focusing on the continued slowdown in fundamentals on the numerator side. At present, the U.S. job market is slowing down significantly, and the PMI in November is lower than market expectations. The economy continues to decline, and we should pay attention to the risk of a correction in cyclical stocks and other stocks. In the domestic market, the sustainability of policy efforts and the marginal changes in capital going north are """"new variables"""" that need to be paid attention to. On the one hand, the additional issuance of """"trillion treasury bonds"""" at the end of October and the """"acceleration"""" of broad fiscal expenditures in October have already shown signs of policy intensification; in December, the policy pace revealed at key meetings is also worthy of attention. On the other hand, whether the logic of improving fundamentals, the trend of RMB appreciation, and the behavior of northbound funds will """"resonate"""" is also one of the """"keys"""" to the market disruption.",,,,

"Foreign exchange market: The U.S. dollar index fell, and the RMB appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar index fell 3.0% to 103.5. The euro and pound appreciated against the US dollar by 3.0% and 3.9% respectively, while the onshore and offshore RMB appreciated by 2.5% and 2.7% against the US dollar respectively to 7.137 and 7.144.",,,,

"Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People\'s Bank of China, said at a press conference of the State Council Information Office on January 24 that the deposit reserve ratio will be lowered by 0.5 percentage points on February 5 to provide 1 trillion yuan of liquidity to the market. On January 25, the re-loan and re-discount interest rates for supporting agriculture and small businesses will be lowered by 0.25 percentage points, from 2% to 1.75%, and will continue to promote the steady decline of comprehensive social financing costs.",,,,
1. Monetary policy: The policy combination returns and monetary easing is stepped up.,,,,
"Starting from February 5, 2024, the deposit reserve ratio of financial institutions will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points (excluding financial institutions that have implemented a 5% deposit reserve ratio). After this reduction, the weighted average deposit reserve ratio of financial institutions will be approximately 7.0%; starting from January 25, 2024, the interest rates of re-loans to support agriculture, re-loans to support small businesses, and rediscount rates will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points each. Since the end of last year, against the background of falling inflation in developed markets, central banks in the United States and Europe have begun to signal a shift from an interest rate hike cycle to a paradigm shift in interest rate cuts. Since then, the depreciation pressure on the RMB has begun to gradually ease, which is conducive to the expansion of domestic policy space. Open. The relatively weak domestic private sector credit and continued weak inflation data in November and December also indicate the inherent necessity of returning to easing policy. This RRR cut and the interest rate cut for relending to support agriculture and small businesses indicate that the policy has returned to the positive path of the overall policy stated in the Central Economic Work Conference. Governor Pan Gongsheng emphasized that liquidity will be maintained at a reasonable and sufficient level in 2024. He also emphasized that the spillover effects of monetary policies in developed economies will develop in the direction of reducing pressure in 2024, and the cyclical differences between China and the United States\' monetary policies are converging. Such a Changes in the external environment are objectively conducive to enhancing China\'s autonomy in monetary policy operations and expanding the space for monetary policy operations. This shows that the return of loose policy is both necessary and sufficient. In addition, the domestic RRR cuts in March and September 2023 are both 25bp, and in the second half of 2023, in order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate, although the country is targeted at loosening, the overall funding level remains in a tight state. This RRR cut Returning to 50bp again indicates that the convergence of Sino-US monetary policy cycles has brought about the autonomy of domestic monetary policy.",,,,
"2. Stock index: The policy combination has once again released signals, and the A-share market is expected to shift to a bottom",,,,
"Recently, the market has been expecting the return of RRR cuts, interest rate cuts and the fiscal policy package. In fact, judging from recent news, the policy package also tends to release signals again. On January 22, the State Council executive meeting listened to a report on the operation of the capital market and work considerations, emphasizing the need to further improve the basic system of the capital market, pay more attention to the dynamic balance of investment and financing; increase the entry of medium and long-term funds into the market, and enhance the inherent stability of the market. At the press conference of the State Council on January 24, the deputy director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission introduced the situation of focusing on enhancing core functions, enhancing core competitiveness, and better achieving high-quality development of central enterprises, and mentioned the need to strengthen investor returns and further study Incorporate market value management into the performance evaluation of heads of central enterprises. Subsequently, at the press conference of the State Council Information Office on the afternoon of January 24, the governor of the central bank announced a cut in reserve requirements and interest rates. As the policy package once again releases signals, the A-share market may be expected to gradually shift to bottoming out after the early panic was released.",,,,
"Judging from recent market performance, a certain amount of panic has been released after New Year\'s Day. Subsequently, congestion in small-cap factor trading and declining liquidity have also boosted the transmission of risk sentiment. In terms of futures index, when some OTC derivatives are facing the process of knock-in, the trading desk needs to reduce long hedging positions, which has some impact on the basis. The basis of various varieties has weakened significantly, and the IC and IM contracts have weakened significantly. There has been a significant expansion in the annual discount rate for term contracts. In terms of volatility of stock index options and ETF options, affected by panic sentiment, the market\'s implied volatility also rose rapidly to a level higher than the historical volatility of the corresponding underlying.",,,,
"With the release of signals of RRR cuts and interest rate cuts, the policy mix may continue to return, and the basic pattern of weak stocks and strong bonds may usher in marginal changes. In terms of market style and structure, the China Special Appraisal and Dividend Sectors may be expected to receive positive feedback under the gradual release of policy combinations; the CSI 500 Index and the CSI 1000 Index are expected to experience an oversold rebound after the market stabilizes, and the overall elasticity may It is higher than the broad-based indexes such as the CSI 300 and the Shanghai Composite 50 that favor the broader market.",,,,
"3Treasury bonds: Policy-friendly period, bull market background remains unchanged",,,,
"This RRR cut will release approximately 1 trillion yuan in medium- and long-term funds, which can effectively supplement market liquidity, reduce bank liability costs, and help banks guide the downward trend of overall financing costs in society. Since the beginning of the year, government bond interest rates have continued to fall, reflecting not only the pricing of high-frequency economic data, but also the expectation of loose monetary policy. This reduction in deposit reserves is a reaffirmation of the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200beasing monetary policy, and it is still in a policy-friendly period. This year’s policy choices are likely to be based on the basic idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bfiscal drama and currency setting the stage. Monetary policy will not only continue to exert force at the aggregate level, but its quasi-fiscal attributes will also be more prominent, ensuring that funds go directly to entities and preventing idling and arbitrage. In the future, we can still look forward to the interest rate cut policy. To grasp the rhythm of time, we can refer to the node where the interest rate cut cycle of global central banks starts. For the Treasury market, the medium-term bull market backdrop remains unchanged. In the short term, we need to pay attention to the impact of the rebound in risk appetite on the market.",,,,
"4. Major categories of assets: Combination boxing returns to correct the """"asset price fall-credit contraction"""" spiral",,,,
"Since November last year, after the Federal Reserve guided the market to price an interest rate cut in 2024, the global equity market has also begun to price the liquidity dividend of a fall in U.S. bond interest rates. After entering January, although the central banks of the United States and Europe began to correct the market\'s leading pricing, the overall liquidity dividend was less disturbed, and the boost to the global equity market still had a certain degree of inertia. For the domestic market, the dividends of U.S. debt liquidity are not smoothly transmitted domestically. Against the backdrop of continued credit contraction in China, a significant pattern of bearish stocks and bullish bonds has emerged. The reason for the obvious credit contraction is that during the New Year\'s Eve, although the capital interest rate has dropped to a certain extent, the inertia of real estate finance contraction still exists, and the financing demand of the private sector is still weak as the capital interest rate continues to fall further. Therefore, the return of policy is still awaited. The failure of expectations for an RRR cut and an interest rate cut in mid-to-early January further put pressure on credit contraction. The pattern of weak stocks and strong debt continued in asset prices. Domestic growth and inflation factors continued to decline. Commodities were weak and the commodity index fluctuated against the background of reality. Mainly downward.",,,,
"This time, the reduction of relending and rediscount rates to support agriculture and small businesses, as well as the deposit reserve interest rate by 0.5%, indicate the return of the policy mix. The fundamental data of continued deflation since the fourth quarter have received policy feedback. At the same time, active liquidity injection has also provided support for the continued decline in asset prices and corrected the short-term """"asset price decline-credit contraction"""" spiral. In the short term, it has a boosting effect on the overall valuation of financial products. In view of the fact that the bond market was relatively crowded when the market was relatively pessimistic about growth, the boosting effect is more obvious for the stock market. The combination of recent policies will have a positive impact on stability. According to relevant statements from the capital market, the stock index is expected to switch to a low and wide range of fluctuations after continuing to release risks. For commodities, considering that the fundamental data of the United States has been relatively resilient under the recent positive fiscal and monetary conditions, the relatively coordinated policy tone between China and the United States will bring certain benefits to the restoration of commodity valuations. In the medium term, it will take time for the substantial improvement from the transmission of monetary policy to credit easing, and attention will be paid to the implementation of subsequent fiscal policies.",,,,

"The year-on-year increase in CPI continues to fluctuate. The supply in the consumer market was generally sufficient in June, with CPI rising by 0.2% year-on-year, 0.1 percentage points lower than in May. Among them, food prices fell by 2.1%, a decline that was 0.1 percentage points larger than in May. Non-food prices rose by 0.8%, the same as in May. Core CPI excluding food and energy prices increased by 0.6% year-on-year, with the same increase as in May. Moderate rise. On average from January to June, CPI increased by 0.1% compared with the same period in 2023, and the cumulative increase for three consecutive months was flat. The cumulative increase for food was -2.7% year-on-year, and the cumulative increase for non-food was 0.8% year-on-year.",,,,
"The month-on-month decline in food prices led to a further expansion of the month-on-month decline in CPI. The CPI fell by 0.2% month-on-month in June, 0.1 percentage points larger than that in May. Among them, food prices changed from being flat in May to falling by 0.6%; among non-food, affected by the fluctuation of international oil prices, domestic gasoline prices fell by 2.0%. Affected by the """"618"""" promotion and other factors, the prices of automobiles, household appliances, and entertainment durable consumer goods dropped by 0.8%. %-1.3%, with more travel approaching the summer vacation, transportation rental fees and air ticket prices increased by 6.4% and 2.5% respectively.",,,,
"Among the eight major categories, food, tobacco and alcohol are the main drag items, and the year-on-year decline in transportation and communication prices has expanded. Among the eight major categories, the price of food, tobacco and alcohol fell by 1.1% year-on-year, among which the prices of pork, aquatic products and grain increased by 18.1%, 1.2% and 0.4% year-on-year. Pork\'s contribution to CPI rebounded significantly year-on-year, and the price of fresh fruits, eggs and fresh vegetables increased significantly. Prices fell by 8.7%, 3.9% and 7.3% year-on-year.

From January to June, the price of consumer goods fell by 0.4% year-on-year, while the price of services increased by 0.9% year-on-year.

"The year-on-year tailing factor of CPI has increased, and the impact of new price increases has weakened.

Looking at the later stage, the impact of the tail-lift factor has weakened in the third quarter. Whether the year-on-year CPI increase can continue to recover moderately will need to be further driven by new price increases. The year-on-year decline in PPI continued to narrow, with a month-on-month decrease. In June, affected by factors such as fluctuations in international commodity prices and insufficient market demand for some domestic industrial products, the national PPI declined month-on-month, and the year-on-year decline continued to narrow. From a year-on-year perspective, PPI fell by 0.8%, a decline that was 0.6 percentage points narrower than that in May. Among them, the price of means of production fell by 0.8%, the decline narrowed by 0.8 percentage points; the price of means of living fell by 0.8%, the decline was the same as in May. At this stage, the recovery on the production side is still stronger than the recovery on the demand side. From a month-on-month perspective, PPI in June turned from an increase of 0.2% in May to a decrease of 0.2%. On average from January to June, PPI fell by 2.1% compared with the same period in 2023, and PPIRM fell by 2.6%.",,,,
"The price recovery in the upstream industry was stronger than that in the midstream industry, and the pattern still showed differentiation. Looking at the main industries, PPI in June fell by 6.9% year-on-year. Prices in the non-metallic mineral products industry fell by 6.9%, prices in the electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing industry fell by 2.9%, prices in the agricultural and sideline food processing industry fell by 2.2%, and prices in the ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry fell by 2.1%. %, prices in the coal mining and washing industry fell by 1.6%, prices in the manufacturing industry of chemical raw materials and chemical products fell by 0.6%, and the declines narrowed; prices in the automobile manufacturing industry fell by 2.3%, and prices in the manufacturing industry of computer communications and other electronic equipment fell by 2.1%. , the declines expanded by 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points respectively; the prices in the non-ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry increased by 11.5%, and the prices in the petroleum, coal and other fuel processing industries increased by 4.0%, and the increases expanded by 2.6 and 0.6 percentage points respectively; the prices in the oil and natural gas mining industry increased 8.0%, the increase fell by 1.4 percentage points.",,,,
"The impact of PPI year-on-year tailing factors tends to be positive, while the impact of new price increases has weakened. Among the year-on-year changes in PPI of -0.8% in June, the impact of tailing was -0.1 percentage points, which was significantly less than that in May, and the new impact of price changes was -0.7 percentage points, which was larger than that in May. In the later period, the impact of the tail-off factor has been positive. Driven by the issuance of ultra-long-term special government bonds and special bonds, the investment side of stabilizing the macroeconomic market still needs to rely on infrastructure investment, which will have a positive impact on the stabilization of the prices of production materials and daily necessities. The effect is expected to further narrow the decline in PPI.",,,,
"The year-on-year increase in CPI in June has declined. Food prices are still a drag, but the positive factors driven by pork prices continue to strengthen. At this stage, the main factors that restrict the recurrence of moderate CPI recovery are still insufficient expectations and sluggish domestic demand. In the later period, it is still necessary to combine stabilizing traditional consumption and cultivating new consumption to stimulate potential consumption, thereby driving the gradual recovery of CPI. In terms of PPI, policy-driven new productivity has accelerated manufacturing investment, fiscal expansion has boosted infrastructure investment, and the negative impact of real estate investment has gradually weakened, which will have a positive effect on the continued narrowing of the PPI decline in the next stage.",,,,

In September, government bonds and undiscounted acceptance bills increased by 441.6 and 226.4 billion yuan year-on-year respectively.

The pace of special bond issuance slowed down in September, and the Ministry of Finance\'s goal of """"basically completing issuance by the end of September"""" has not yet been achieved. There is still a small amount in the fourth quarter, but the follow-up momentum is expected to be limited.

"The number of new RMB loans in September was slightly lower than expected, but significantly exceeded the seasonality. The obvious decrease year-on-year was mainly due to the strong credit development in the same period last year. Due to the high base in the same period last year and the pre-emptive efforts in corporate credit this year, corporate mid- and long-term loans and short-term loans have decreased year-on-year for three consecutive months, and subsequent growth momentum may be relatively limited. Against the background of the overall sluggish recovery in real estate sales, medium- and long-term residential loans strengthened significantly in September, with an increase of 201.4 billion yuan year-on-year. This constituted the main support for credit in September. This may be related to the decline in the prepayment rate of mortgage loans caused by the reduction of existing mortgage interest rates.",,,,
"The year-on-year growth rates of M1 and M2 have further declined, which is consistent with credit being less than expected, reflecting the overall weak economic recovery vitality.

This article briefly summarizes the origin and development of the red lines of the deficit ratio and government debt ratio.,,,,
"The famous Maastricht Treaty in 1991 stipulated the upper limits on the deficit ratio and government debt of member states: first, the deficit ratio should not exceed 3%; second, the total government debt should not exceed 60% of GDP. %. Entering the 21st century, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom have successively exceeded the 60% debt ratio red line. In 2003, the """"horse line"""" existed in name only. In 2020, the EU launched a general exception clause, allowing member states to exceed the red line and avoid penalties under special circumstances. After the outbreak of the Ukrainian conflict, this clause was extended to 2023, and the fiscal discipline was officially deactivated. During this period, in order to stimulate the economy, the government debt ratio of European countries continued to rise. According to IMF data, the EU\'s overall public debt ratio has reached 91% in 2022.",,,,
"In 2023, the European Commission published a proposal to revise the economic governance framework, starting the process of reforming the fiscal discipline rules in the Stability and Growth Pact. The red line remains unchanged under the new rules, but is more flexible. When the government debt ratio exceeds the reference value and the deficit ratio exceeds the limit by 0.3 percentage points, or exceeds the cumulative limit by 0.6 percentage points, the European Council will initiate excessive deficit procedures, requiring net fiscal spending to be reduced by 0.5 percentage points of GDP each year. With European countries facing high debt levels and weak economic recovery, it is still unclear whether the above-mentioned reforms can be implemented and whether the new rules can truly take effect.",,,,
"After the subprime mortgage crisis spread around the world in 2009, quantitative easing and fiscal bailouts in many countries led to record high government debt. Rogoff and Reinhart proposed a new red line of 90% in 2010, that is, economies with a public debt ratio of more than 90% came to a standstill. , the debt ratio has a non-linear impact on economic growth. At present, there may be consensus on the following points regarding the public debt ceiling:",,,,
"First, there is no unified debt red line, and there is no unilateral causal relationship between public debt and economic growth. The ratio of Japanese government debt to GDP exceeds 200%, but there is no debt crisis. On the contrary, Chad\'s debt ratio is only 48% in 2020, but it is deep in debt crisis.",,,,
"Second, a country\'s debt ceiling is affected by factors such as debt structure, financing efficiency, and growth prospects. One of the key factors is the ratio of domestic and foreign debt. If domestic debt dominates and fiscal sustainability is relatively strong, the government can resolve the debt through invisible seigniorage. If foreign debt is dominated by foreign debt, usually denominated in dollars or euros, the sustainability of the debt depends on the country\'s foreign exchange reserves, foreign trade, capital inflows and other factors.",,,,
"Third, china’s public debt ceiling may be relatively high. On the one hand, china\'s economic growth is expected to be stable. On the other hand, china\'s government debt is relatively low in external dependence, mainly domestic debt, with a long term, and a large scale of foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, china\'s fiscal policy space is still sufficient in a horizontal comparison, and the central government has more room to increase leverage.",,,,

"Recently, in accordance with the clear requirements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to improve the consumer environment and a series of arrangements for the disclosure of consumer complaint information, and in accordance with relevant laws and policies, the State Administration for Market Regulation issued the """"Interim Rules for the Disclosure of Market Supervision and Administration Complaint Information"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Disclosure Rules"""" ).

"Reporter: What is the background of the drafting of the """"Public Notice Rules""""?",,,,
"Answer: As the saying goes, """"Shop around"""". Consumers\' independent choice is a key link in playing a decisive role in market allocation of resources, and is the intrinsic driving force for fair market competition and high-quality development. At present, consumers still face market information asymmetry. The credit system and social supervision mechanism in the consumer field need to be improved, which to a certain extent restricts the efficiency of market allocation of resources. Some operators have high complaints, and some consumers report strong pain points and difficulties, which restrict the expansion of consumption. The blockages and petechiae need to be solved urgently. At the same time, the traditional government supervision model faces the bottleneck of fewer people and more tasks. It is necessary to practice the mass line, promote institutional innovation, and improve supervision efficiency.",,,,

The market supervision departments carry out unified disclosure of consumer complaint information across the country and proactively disclose relevant government information. This is a concrete measure to implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and improve the consumer rights protection system with Chinese characteristics, so that consumers can consume with confidence and all types of Operators compete fairly and operate with integrity.",,,,
"Reporter: What is the main purpose of formulating the """"Public Notice Rules""""?",,,,
"Answer: First, reduce information asymmetry in the consumer market and consolidate the socialist market economic system. Consumer complaint disclosure puts scattered complaints across the country on the same platform, which can better protect consumers’ rights to know and choose, improve the market allocation mechanism; promote the survival of the fittest in various industries, improve quality and upgrade, and promote high-level unification and high-level consumer markets across the country. Standard construction. The second is to improve the credit system in the consumer sector and improve the integrity of operators. Currently, enterprise-related information mainly focuses on registration and licensing, administrative law enforcement, and judicial litigation, with insufficient consumer participation. Disclosure of consumer complaints is an important part of implementing the Party’s mass line in the new era and improving the credit system in the consumer field, strengthening both credit constraints and incentives. The third is to strengthen social supervision in the field of consumption and promote the management of the source of consumer disputes. In the face of the continued rapid growth of complaints, consumer complaint publicity is problem-oriented and pressure-driven, guiding operators to resolve consumer disputes at the source in a timely manner, enhancing operators\' awareness of proactive reconciliation and cooperation in mediation, and promoting the """"source reduction"""" of complaints. The fourth is to innovate the consumption environment governance model and improve the efficiency of market supervision and rights protection. The publicity of consumer complaints is an entry point to promote the """"three supervisions"""" in an integrated manner, which can make up for the lack of supervision and promote social co-governance. At the same time, it is also a new measure to improve work style, promote fairness through openness, standardize business operations and government performance, and improve the level of standardization of grassroots work.",,,,
Reporter: The General Administration organized pilot projects in many places in the early stage. How was the results?,,,,
"Answer: Since 2016, the State Administration for Market Regulation has guided Shanghai, Chongqing, Jiangxi and other places to explore pilot projects, conduct forward-looking research, and achieve initial results. On this basis, the General Administration has studied to formulate unified publicity rules and build a unified publicity platform. Starting from November 2022, it will be piloted in six provinces of Jilin, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Xinjiang in two phases, and six sub-websites will be established. The number of consumer complaints in the above-mentioned regions accounts for nearly half of the country\'s total, covering most of the first-tier cities and large platform companies where complaints are concentrated, covering the east and west, north and south, large, medium and small cities, and has a strong reference for national publicity. As of the end of the pilot in October this year, a total of 1.4691 million complaints from 700,800 operators have been publicized in the six places, with an average mediation success rate of 52.43%, an increase of 8.78 percentage points from before the pilot; Awareness has increased significantly, especially for operators with high complaint volume. The effect of """"source reduction"""" has been outstanding, allowing consumers to intuitively feel the improvement of the consumption environment around them.",,,,
"Since the beginning of this year, central media such as People\'s Daily, CCTV, Economic Daily, Rule of Law Daily, and Workers\' Daily have reported on consumer complaint announcements. Many experts have published interpretation articles. The public generally has high evaluations and believes that it has a strong guiding role. So far, no enterprise has applied for objection review or administrative reconsideration litigation.",,,,
Reporter: Which consumer complaints will be made public?,,,,
"Answer: The scope of publicity is the core of the consumer complaint publicity system. Based on the civil nature of consumer disputes, the voluntary nature of administrative mediation, and the neutral nature of government information disclosure, in order to objectively and comprehensively disclose the consumer environment and ensure that the whole country has a ruler, we adhere to the principle of """"full disclosure"""" and regard disclosure as the norm and non-disclosure as the exception. . Regardless of whether the operator has violated the law or whether the complaint has been settled, it will be made public to avoid any differential treatment and manual intervention. Consumer complaints are as subjective as consumer reviews. It is this diverse and personalized complaint that is aggregated into dynamic big data, providing consumers with more references. At the same time, in order to ensure the rigor of complaint information and avoid abuse of the publicity system, we publicize the complaints that have been completed. The following complaints will not be publicized: First, they should not be accepted according to law. Second, consumers and operators reconciled in advance through the ODR mechanism of the national 12315 platform. The third is a false or malicious complaint; the fourth is other disclosures that may endanger national security, public safety, economic security, social stability or violate public order and good customs. Related Links:",,,,
"It should be noted that the settlement between the two parties shows that the operators actively fulfill their main responsibilities, and a high settlement rate can dispel concerns and boost consumption willingness. If the reconciled complaints are not publicized, although the number of publicized complaints will be reduced, the proportion of """"unsuccessful mediation"""" in publicized complaints will be too high, which will instead affect consumer confidence and expand the scope for system abuse. The General Administration has integrated suggestions from all parties, insisted on full disclosure, and guided consumers to reconcile with operators in advance through the platform\'s ODR mechanism, and simultaneously disclosed the operators\' """"advance settlement rate"""" to play the role of both credit constraints and incentives.",,,,
Reporter: What are the specific disclosure contents of consumer complaints?,,,,
"Answer: The publicity content is the basis of the consumer complaint publicity system. The detailed setting of publicity content must not only meet the purpose of publicity and disclose targeted information, but also protect personal privacy and corporate goodwill, unify data standards, and ensure data quality. The """"Publicity Rules"""" stipulate that the publicity directly uses the data of the National 12315 Platform, and the system automatically generates a template according to the data category, specifically including: the complainant\'s surname, the National 12315 Platform ID, the last four digits of the phone number; the name, address, and unified social credit of the respondent Code; the product service complained of, sales method; complaint time, dispute occurrence time, complaint issues, complaint requests; settlement time, processing results, and the market supervision department that handles the complaint. The results include reaching a mediation agreement, not reaching a mediation agreement, the complainant withdraws, or both parties reconcile on their own. If the respondent is exempted from market entity registration according to law or has not yet registered as a market entity, the name and address of the store (online store, live broadcast room, etc.) shall be published. If the actual business address of the respondent is inconsistent with the registered address, the actual business address may be announced together. Most of the above information is typed information and will not infringe personal privacy and business secrets.",,,,
"It should be noted that the """"complaint issues"""" in the publicity content are the categories selected by consumers when they complain. They mainly reflect the causes of consumer disputes and are not equivalent to illegal acts or infringement facts determined by the market supervision department after investigation. Complaints are not reports, and consumer disputes and illegal infringement cannot be simply equated.",,,,
"Reporter: What do the """"Public Notice Rules"""" stipulate on the method of public disclosure?",,,,
"Answer: The publicity of consumer complaints follows the principle of objectivity and fairness. The quality of goods and services and the integrity and compliance of operators need to be comprehensively judged based on multiple dimensions such as market share, number of complaints, complaint growth rate, mediation and settlement, horizontal comparison of industry regions, and vertical comparison of own history. It is not suitable to be ranked simply by a single dimension. At the same time, nationwide publicity needs to ensure data collection and unified standards. Therefore, the General Administration has established a national 12315 consumer complaint information disclosure platform to collect and publish consumer complaint information handled by market supervision departments across the country. The publicity platform adopts a """"decentralized publicity + comprehensive search"""" model and automatically collects statistics based on objective dimensions such as settlement time, administrative division, industry category, product service category, complaint issue category, number of complaints, complaint growth rate, mediation success rate, advance settlement rate, etc. ,Classification. The public can also combine searches according to their own needs to check the complaints of specific merchants, understand real-time complaint hot spots, browse the latest local complaints, etc.",,,,
Reporter: Some operators have concerns about publicizing consumer complaints. What considerations does the General Administration have in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises?,,,,
"Answer: While publicizing consumer complaints, the General Administration always coordinates the maintenance of the consumer environment and business environment, protects the legitimate rights and interests of all parties, and prevents the publicity system from being abused. The """"Publicity Rules"""" specifically adopt various measures: First, clarify the objective and neutral nature of publicity. Complaint information includes subjective statements of consumer complaints and the results of voluntary administrative mediation by both parties, and does not belong to negative credit information such as administrative penalties, lists of abnormal business operations, lists of serious violations of law and dishonesty. Local market regulatory authorities should strengthen publicity, guidance and policy interpretation in this regard. The second is to strictly control the scope of complaints that will not be accepted and not publicized. Coordinate the publicity end and the acceptance front end, and set up special clauses to require the market supervision department to strictly review complaint materials. Complaints that are repeated, anonymous, not for daily consumption, and do not involve consumer rights disputes will not be accepted. Accepted complaints will not be publicized. The third is to set up an objection review procedure. If an operator believes that the content of the publicity of complaints involving itself is wrong or should not be publicized, it may apply in writing to the market regulatory authority that made the publicity decision for review. The fourth is to publicize positive information. Publicize the mediation success rate of operators to encourage fair and healthy competition; operators who join the national 12315 platform ODR mechanism will be given a prominent logo of """"ODR Green Channel Enterprise"""" and the advance settlement rate will be announced to encourage operators to resolve more consumer disputes At the source and in the germ.",,,,
"It should be noted that the publicity of consumer complaints is not a simple """"blacklist"""", and the number of complaints cannot simply be equated to the quality of goods or services. Operators with higher market shares tend to have more consumer disputes. . Compared with the number of complaints, we also need to pay attention to the operator\'s attitude towards consumers, sincerity in handling complaints, and self-improvement. We believe that the public will have rational understanding and judgment.",,,,
"Reporter: We noticed that the national 12315 consumer complaint information disclosure platform has an """"Enterprise Services"""" section. What are its specific functions?",,,,
"Answer: In practice, the after-sales system of some companies is not yet complete. There are difficulties such as incomplete base figures, information asymmetry, and untimely follow-up regarding how many times they have been complained about and what problems consumers have reported. In order to give full play to the positive role of consumer complaint disclosure in promoting high-quality development of enterprises and truly open up the chain of post-supervision and pre-prevention, the """"Disclosure Rules"""" creatively set up corporate service terms. We have developed a dedicated enterprise service section on the national 12315 consumer complaint information disclosure platform to provide enterprises with notification, query, statistics, and analysis functions of their own complaint information. Through 12315 data empowerment, we can guide standardization and improvement of business behavior, and improve the quality of goods and services. Improve after-sales services and enhance the ability to handle and prevent consumer disputes. Enterprises can log in to the platform with their electronic business license.",,,,
"Reporter: In addition to unified disclosure on the national 12315 consumer complaint information disclosure platform, will other disclosures be expanded?",,,,
"Answer: The disclosure of consumer complaints is still an innovative work under exploration. The """"Disclosure Rules"""" are called """"Interim Rules"""" and follow the principles of """"first easy before difficult"""" and """"seeking progress while maintaining stability"""", and first establish a preliminary unified disclosure framework. The State Administration for Market Regulation encourages local governments to actively explore, based on actual conditions, key publicity and classified publicity of relevant regions, industries, operators, goods and services, brands, issues and other dimensions; actively explore the creation of safe consumption, online consumer dispute resolution mechanisms, electronic Integrate business licenses, grassroots consumer rights protection service stations and other work; actively expand online and offline publicity channels such as government websites and new media platforms, media, communities, and business districts; collaborate with other departments and institutions to carry out publicity, etc. Local governments can also, based on work needs, comprehensively carry out hierarchical and classified supervision, administrative guidance interviews, consumption reminders and warnings for industries, regions, and operators with concentrated and rapid increases in complaints and possible major risks. Shanxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and other places have spontaneously explored and achieved positive results. We will listen to opinions and suggestions from all parties and continue to improve the publicity work.",,,,
"Recently, the State Administration of Financial Supervision revised and issued the """"Measures for the Administration of Consumer Finance Companies"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Measures""""). The heads of relevant departments and bureaus answered reporters\' questions on relevant issues.",,,,
1. What is the background of the revision of the Measures?,,,,
"After years of development, the business model and risk characteristics of the consumer finance company industry have undergone significant changes, and the current methods are no longer able to meet the high-quality development and regulatory needs of consumer finance companies. At the same time, in recent years, regulatory authorities have promulgated a series of regulatory systems and regulations in aspects such as corporate governance, equity management, and consumer rights protection. The Measures further supplement and improve relevant content based on the actual situation of the consumer finance company industry, and strengthen the connection with current regulatory regulations. . The revision of the """"Measures"""" is conducive to further strengthening the supervision of consumer finance companies, preventing financial risks, improving institutional positioning, optimizing financial services, strengthening the protection of consumer rights and interests, and promoting high-quality development of the industry.",,,,
2. What are the main revisions to the Measures?,,,,
"The """"Measures"""" include ten chapters and 79 articles. The main revisions are as follows: First, improve access standards. Improve the asset, operating income and other indicator standards of major investors, as well as the minimum shareholding ratio requirements, strengthen the shareholder responsibilities of major investors; increase the shareholding ratio of investors with experience in consumer finance business management and risk control, and promote their better performance of professionalism and risk control; increase the minimum registered capital requirements for consumer finance companies and enhance risk resistance. The second is to strengthen business classification supervision. Distinguish between basic business and special business scope, cancel non-main business and non-essential business, and strictly regulate hierarchical business. Appropriately expand financing channels and enhance shareholders\' liquidity support capabilities. The third is to strengthen corporate governance supervision. Comprehensively implement the regulatory regulations and institutional requirements on corporate governance, shareholder equity, related transactions and information disclosure issued in recent years, and combine the organizational form, ownership structure and other characteristics of consumer finance companies to clarify the party building, """"three meetings and one layer"""" , shareholder obligations, compensation management, related transactions, information disclosure and other regulatory requirements. The fourth is to strengthen risk management. Clarify the regulatory requirements for consumer finance companies in terms of credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, information technology risk, reputation risk management, etc., optimize and add some regulatory indicators, and improve the market exit mechanism. The fifth is to strengthen the protection of consumer rights and interests. Adhere to the people-centered approach, consolidate the main responsibilities of consumer finance companies for consumer protection, improve various mechanisms for consumer protection work, strengthen the standardized management of cooperative institutions, and effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers.",,,,
3. Why does the Measures increase the minimum shareholding ratio requirement for major investors in consumer finance companies?,,,,
"The """"Measures"""" increase the shareholding ratio requirement for major investors in consumer finance companies from no less than 30% to no less than 50%. Main considerations: First, judging from regulatory practice in recent years, increasing the shareholding ratio of major investors is conducive to consolidating shareholder responsibilities, enhancing shareholders\' willingness to participate in the company\'s operations, better utilizing the advantages of shareholders\' resources, and promoting shareholders to actively play a supportive role. Second, it is conducive to improving decision-making efficiency and avoiding the problem of corporate governance failure and imbalance due to relatively dispersed equity.",,,,
"4. What adjustments does the """"Measures"""" have to the business scope of consumer finance companies?",,,,
"The """"Measures"""" optimize and adjust the business scope of consumer finance companies to focus more on their main businesses. On the one hand, distinguish between basic business and special business. Seven businesses including “issuance of personal consumption loans” and “issuance of non-capital bonds” will be included in the basic business, and two businesses including “asset securitization business” and “fixed income securities investment business” will be included in the special business. On the other hand, non-main businesses and non-essential businesses will be cancelled. In view that agency sales of insurance may lead to an increase in complaints and disputes related to consumer finance companies, and the industry basically does not carry out such business, the """"agency sales of insurance products related to consumer loans"""" business has been cancelled.",,,,
"5. What are the main changes in the regulatory indicators of the """"Measures""""?",,,,
"First, increase the regulatory indicators for guaranteed credit-enhancement loan business. In view of the fact that some consumer finance companies are highly dependent on financing guarantee companies and insurance companies to cover risks, which is not conducive to improving independent risk control capabilities and indirectly increases the level of comprehensive loan interest rates, the """"Measures"""" require that the balance of guaranteed credit enhancement loans shall not exceed 50% of the total loan balance. %. The second is to increase the liquidity ratio supervision indicator. Based on the operating characteristics and risk characteristics of consumer finance companies, and on the basis of prudent calculations, the """"Measures"""" stipulate that the """"liquidity ratio"""" shall not be less than 50%.",,,,
"6. What considerations does the """"Measures"""" have in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of financial consumers?",,,,
"The """"Measures"""" added two special chapters, """"Consumer Rights Protection"""" and """"Cooperative Institution Management"""", to highlight and strengthen the protection of consumer rights and interests. On the one hand, we need to consolidate the consumer protection main responsibilities of consumer finance companies. It is required to incorporate consumer rights protection into corporate governance, establish and improve consumer protection working mechanisms, establish consumer rights protection committees, improve consumer protection information disclosure mechanisms and personal information protection systems, and strengthen consumer suitability management. On the other hand, strengthen the restraint management of cooperative institutions. Consumer finance companies are required to strengthen the list management and centralized management of cooperative institutions, conduct continuous management and evaluation of cooperative institutions, clarify the prohibitive regulations of cooperative institutions, and avoid infringing the legitimate rights and interests of consumers due to non-standard collection by cooperative institutions, especially collection agencies. ; Require consumer finance companies to implement the main responsibilities of collection management, formulate performance assessment and reward and punishment mechanisms for collection agencies, carry out entrusted collection activities in accordance with laws and regulations, and effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of financial consumers.",,,,
"7. What is the status of the public solicitation of opinions on the """"Measures""""?",,,,
"In December 2023, the """"Measures"""" publicly solicited opinions from the public. Most of the rationalization opinions and suggestions fed back by all parties were adopted. The unadopted opinions were mainly focused on expanding business scope, increasing loan credit limits, increasing branch establishment terms, and reducing supervision. Incorrect understanding of indicator requirements and provisions. The solicitation of opinions involves explanations and transition period arrangements for relevant provisions, such as the connection of administrative licensing work, the time for paid-in capital to meet the standards, the period for reducing the proportion of guaranteed credit enhancement loans, the scope of """"consulting"""" and """"agency"""" business, etc., and is planned to be included in the """" Detailed provisions and explanations are provided in the supporting notification documents of the Measures.",,,,
"The European Central Bank stayed on hold in March, and the probability of an interest rate cut in June increased: the European Central Bank kept the policy interest rate unchanged at the March monetary policy meeting. The Asset Purchase Program (APP) is expected to be passively reduced by about 25 billion euros per month, and the Epidemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) There will be a reduction in the middle of the year; the ECB\'s theoretical average monthly balance reduction will rise to 32.5 billion euros per month in the middle of the year, but it will still be more restrained than the Fed. The European Central Bank has lowered its outlook for inflation growth. From 2024 to 2026, nominal HICP is expected to grow by 2.3%, 2.0% and 1.9% respectively; core HICP is 2.6%, 2.1% and 2.0%, indicating that inflation is stable close to 2.0%. % target confidence. At the same time, the European Central Bank\'s outlook for the economy is even more bleak, with actual growth expected to be only 0.6% in 2024 (significantly lower than last year\'s outlook of 1.0%). Generally speaking, the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy shift may come in the middle of the year, and at the same time, the US and European central banks will enter a new state of """"cutting interest rates while shrinking their balance sheets.""""",,,,
"The European Central Bank\'s """"demand side"""" monetary operating framework: The adjustment to the operating framework planned by the European Central Bank on September 18 is based on the idea of \u200b\u200bdetermining the desired liquidity level through the demand side, and is consistent with the """"amplereserve"""" on the supply side explored by the Federal Reserve. ) thinking is different. Reducing the spread between the Main Refinancing Rate (MRO) and the Deposit Facility Rate (DFR) from 50 BP to 15 BP will compress the scope of the policy interest rate corridor formed by the two and reduce the borrowing costs of banks and other financial institutions using MRO, similar to the Federal Reserve\'s compression of banks. Reserve requirement ratio (IORB) and discount window spreads. After the spread between MRO and DFR is compressed, the cost for banks to relieve liquidity pressure through MRO will be reduced, which will encourage banks to use MRO when they face liquidity shortages due to balance sheet shrinkage and other factors. The ECB can also use MRO through banks’ borrowing volume and Frequently observe whether the balance sheet reduction process has caused a serious shortage of liquidity. Compared with calculating the appropriate reserve level from the supply side of liquidity, it is more convenient for the ECB to observe the impact of balance sheet shrinkage on liquidity from the demand side.",,,,
"The labor market is tight, and inflation will follow energy and commodities to further decline: In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate in the 20 euro zone countries fell to a record low of 6.4% in January, and wages remain resilient, which may have a weak impact on the prices of services and goods within the euro zone. support. In February, the year-on-year growth rate of Eurozone HICP further slowed to 2.6% from 2.8% previously; core HICP growth slowed to 3.1% year-on-year from 3.3% previously. From a structural point of view, food, energy and commodity prices are further easing. Goods inflation was 2.0% in January and 1.6% in February; services inflation fell slightly to 3.9% in February after remaining at 4.0% for three consecutive months; most underlying inflation indicators fell back at the beginning of the year. This also supports the European Central Bank\'s downward revision of its inflation forecast.",,,,
"The performance of the manufacturing industry is weak, and economic growth expectations are lowered again: in the short term, consumer spending is still suppressed by interest rates, investment has slowed, corporate exports have decreased, and the downward pressure on the economy has not been relieved. The plight of the euro zone manufacturing industry is obvious: the euro zone manufacturing PMI fell further to 45.7 in March (previous value 46.5), the German manufacturing PMI fell to 41.6 (previous value 42.5), and France fell to 45.8 (previous value 47.1). Its industrial production index and capacity utilization are at their lowest levels since 2008. Although the consumer confidence index has rebounded from the bottom, its effect is still mainly reflected in the marginal recovery of demand in the service industry. The retail sales index recorded a negative growth of 1.0% year-on-year in January and only 0.1% month-on-month, indicating that consumption in the first quarter may still be weak. In terms of imports and exports, merchandise exports increased by 2.8% year-on-year in January, while merchandise imports registered a negative growth of 15.5% year-on-year. Although exports have improved, the weakness of imports means that the consumption power of the Eurozone is insufficient, and domestic demand cannot support the recovery of economic expansion. Economic weakness also points to a cut in policy rates.",,,,
"The potential turnaround of the European Central Bank and economic weakness have supported the passive maintenance of the US dollar index at a high level: Despite the relatively dovish stance of the Federal Reserve at the March FOMC meeting, the US dollar index has recently rebounded to the bias due to the obvious weakness of the euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc. high position. In the week of March 18-24, factors such as European PMI and other economic data were still weak, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates but was very cautious about further tightening, and the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates, all of which contributed significantly to the rise of the US dollar. As the currency that has the most obvious impact on the U.S. dollar index, the performance of the euro will depend on the gap between European and American economies and trade, inflation, interest rates and other factors. Under the assumption that the European Central Bank will not cut interest rates later than the Federal Reserve, the Eurozone manufacturing industry will drive economic weakness, inflation is expected to decline smoothly, and the U.S. economy will remain strong with labor market and fiscal support, the U.S. dollar index is likely to continue to rise in the coming quarter. Passive factors remain high (above 103), although the Fed, which is inclined to cut interest rates, may not make a hawkish statement.",,,,

The external environment has been repaired and export growth has increased.,,,,
"CPI growth rate remains unchanged, base effect PPI decline narrows",,,,
"Government bonds are gradually developing, and social financing scale support is strengthened",,,,
Looking to the future: Policies to stabilize growth will continue to be effective and economic recovery will continue.,,,,
"Since 2024, with the steady recovery of industrial demand and the continued efforts to stabilize growth policies, industrial output has grown steadily. On the demand side, the effect of """"replacing old goods with new ones"""" has been further released, and the growth rates of manufacturing investment and consumption of some consumer goods have stopped falling and increased. In May, the domestic and international environment improved, and external demand grew faster than expected. However, the current endogenous growth momentum is insufficient, and investment growth is more affected by policies. The overall stabilization of the domestic economy still needs further recovery.",,,,
"In May 2024, the added value of the national industrial enterprises above designated size increased by 5.6% year-on-year, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points from the previous period, which was lower than market expectations. Among them, the high-tech industry increased by 10% year-on-year, significantly higher than other sub-sectors. From January to May 2024, the added value of industries above designated size increased by 6.2% year-on-year, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points from the previous period. With the continued implementation of policies to stabilize growth, including the continued advancement of equipment trade-in and financial support policies, and the increasing endogenous power brought about by the continued growth of profits of industrial enterprises, the stable operation of the industrial economy has been strongly supported.",,,,
"Consumption: In May 2024, total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 3.7% year-on-year, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from April. Affected by the base effect, the growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods from March to May was highly volatile. This month, the """"trade-in"""" effect appeared, and the growth rate of household appliances and other consumption increased significantly. However, the overall consumption growth rate is still at the bottom, and further progress is needed. Stable employment and income expectations.",,,,
"Investment: From January to May 2024, national fixed asset investment increased by 4.0% year-on-year, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from the previous period. Although the investment growth rate has increased due to the policy of stabilizing growth, the endogenous driving force is insufficient and the investment motivation is single. The risk of economic and investment fluctuations still exists, and the overall stabilization needs further revision.",,,,
"Exports: In May 2024, the total export volume was US$302.35 billion, a year-on-year increase of 7.6%, an increase of 6.1 percentage points from the previous month. China\'s foreign affairs activities were frequent in May, and Chinese high-level officials visited three European countries: France, Serbia, and Hungary. As interactions between China and major Western countries increase, the early tense foreign trade environment has eased, which is conducive to exports.",,,,
"In terms of imports: In May 2024, the total import volume was US$219.73 billion, a year-on-year increase of 1.8%. The growth rate of import volume adjusted slightly, down 6.6 percentage points from the previous period. China\'s domestic economy was running smoothly in May, but the base effect that drove the import growth in the previous month disappeared, resulting in a slight correction in import growth this month, but it continued to grow positively year-on-year.",,,,
"CPI: In May 2024, CPI increased by 0.3% year-on-year, the same as the previous month, and increased by -0.1% month-on-month, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. The overall relative supply is sufficient, which is the fundamental reason why the CPI growth rate continues to hover at a low level.

The slow recovery of the real estate market, uncertainties in the external environment still exist, and the overall demand for industrial products is weaker than the supply, which is the main reason for the year-on-year decline in PPI. This month, the year-on-year decline in PPI narrowed, mainly due to the base effect and the impact of rising international commodity prices.",,,,
"Social financing: In May 2024, the new social financing scale was 2.0692 billion yuan, an increase of 513.2 billion yuan compared with the same period last year, which was significantly higher than market expectations.

"RMB loans: In May 2024, new RMB loans were 950 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 410 billion yuan, which was lower than market expectations. Overall, new RMB loans in May increased significantly year-on-year, bill momentum was obvious, and the corporate loan structure needs to be optimized. Short-term, medium- and long-term loans to residents and enterprises all showed a significant year-on-year decrease, which constituted a drag on credit data.

Overall, the sharp decline trend of M2 and M1 in recent months shows no signs of improvement. M2 has hit a new low since the indicator was recorded, the negative growth rate of M1 has expanded, and the growth scissor gap between M2 and M1 has further widened. The lack of vitality in domestic demand in the economy and the decline in consumption and investment willingness are also caused by the continued impact of prohibiting banks from collecting savings through manual interest payments.",,,,
"Use two keywords to summarize the economic prosperity since the end of 2023, """"low level"""" and """"marginal improvement."""" Taking the manufacturing PMI as an example, the PMI in January this year was only higher than January 2009 in the same period, and December last year was only higher than the same period in 2008 and 2022 (the former background was the global financial crisis, and the latter was the spread of the epidemic) . However, judging from the month-on-month changes, the improvement in PMI in December last year and January this year was better than seasonal. So who is more important?",,,,
"Exports are the main source of marginal improvement. However, judging from the data, most cautious companies choose to speed up production and digest orders on hand. Corporate procurement and employment clearly lag behind production. Of course, the data from January to February every year is noisy due to holidays, but we still believe that policies should pay more attention to the """"level"""" of the economy and give more care to improvements.",,,,
"The need for interest rate cuts has increased significantly.

Especially when the PMI is lower than 50% for more than three months, there will be """"strong help"""" in the form of monetary policy cuts and interest rate cuts (the gray shaded area in Figure 2). At present, the reserve requirement ratio reduction in January has been implemented, and an interest rate cut may also be on the way. From the data point of view:",,,,
"The main support for the month-on-month improvement in PMI is the simultaneous improvement in production and demand. The PMI in December 2023 was slightly stronger than the seasonal decline, which to a certain extent supported the increase in the PMI in January 2024. The simultaneous improvement in production and demand has also become the main reason for the rise in PMI. After three months, demand and production have changed from being a drag to a pull.",,,,
"On the demand side, both the PMI new orders index, which represents domestic demand, and the PMI new export orders index, which represents external demand, rose. However, the two major indices that are still below the boom-bust line indicate that there is still a lot of room for upward growth in subsequent demand. Business surveys show that the proportion of companies reporting insufficient market demand in January was 59.9% (-0.8pct month-on-month). The """"crux"""" of weak demand recovery may be unraveling.",,,,
"On the supply side, the PMI production index also successfully turned from falling to rising, recording a good result of 51.3% in January (+1.1pct month-on-month). This also continued the theme of """"production is stronger than demand"""" in 2023. It is worth noting that due to the delay in the complete recovery of demand, the PMI production and operating activity expectation index fell by 1.9pct month-on-month in January, the largest decline in the past 10 months. This also urgently requires policy efforts to """" Promote demand and ensure supply.”",,,,
"The two major price indexes """"joined hands"""" to decline, and industrial profits were once again under pressure. In January, the PMI raw material purchasing price index was 50.4% (-1.1pct month-on-month). Market demand is still weak, which has also led to a short-term decline in raw material prices. At the same time, the PMI factory price index also declined (-0.7pct month-on-month), and the decline in raw material prices was greater than the factory price. Perhaps this is a good thing for the midstream and downstream industries, which can further open up their profit margins while reducing costs. But price is also a """"double-edged sword"""", which also means that upstream profits may be under pressure.",,,,
"The export chain may be more dependent on large enterprises. Judging not only from the PMI value, but also from the month-on-month growth rate of PMI, the operating conditions of various industrial enterprises seem to be positively related to their size - the PMI of large, medium and small enterprises in January was 50.4% (month-on-month +0.4pct) and 48.9 respectively. % (+0.2pct), 47.2% (month-on-month -0.1pct). Different from the overall upward trend of the PMI new export order index, the new export order index of small enterprises in January (-2.3pct month-on-month) fell sharply, and the export chain may rely more on destocking by large enterprises. As we said in previous reports, on the road to economic recovery, perhaps the focus of """"stabilizing the economy"""" lies in large traditional enterprises, allowing state-owned enterprises to fully play their role as """"leaders"""" in traditional industries.",,,,
"The new round of replenishment cycle may come relatively weakly. The PMI finished goods inventory index rose in January, which may also indicate that the starting point of a new round of inventory replenishment cycle has """"quietly"""" begun. However, we believe that this replenishment is not driven by the demand side, but more from existing inventory. Bottomed out. At present, the difference between PMI purchasing volume and production index is still widening. Against the background of weak demand, manufacturers are more cautious in purchasing willingness. Most manufacturers may be taking advantage of the export chain to cut prices and remove inventory, which also explains the main reason for the decline in the price index to a certain extent.",,,,
"The non-manufacturing industry is still far from a """"good start"""". The slight counter-seasonal increase in the manufacturing PMI shows that the industry has initially achieved a """"good start"""" in 2024, but the construction industry and the service industry have not. The PMI of the construction industry in January was 53.9% (-3.0 pct month-on-month), once again reaching the lowest value for the same period in history since data is available. The boosting effect of the additional issuance of trillions of treasury bonds at the end of October seems to be somewhat """"insufficient"""". The PMI of the service industry in January was 50.1% (+0.8pct month-on-month). Although it was higher than the previous value, it was also the lowest level for the same period in history.",,,,

"The Fed kept interest rates unchanged, and slower-than-expected inflation data supported market expectations for a rate cut.",,,,
"In the early morning of June 13, Beijing time, the Federal Reserve announced the resolution of its June interest rate meeting, maintaining the current interest rate unchanged and setting the federal funds rate target range at 5.25%-5.50%, in line with market expectations. This meeting is the seventh consecutive time since September 2023 that interest rates have been kept unchanged. On the other hand, the implementation of bond purchases has been reduced. Starting from June, the monthly repayment limit of U.S. Treasury bonds has been reduced from US$60 billion to US$25 billion, while the upper limit of repayment of agency bonds and MBS has remained unchanged at US$35 billion. This meeting is a quarter-end meeting and the latest economic forecasts and dot plots were announced.",,,,
"Inflation data that have continued to be higher than expected since the first quarter has prompted the Federal Reserve to slow down the pace of interest rate cuts and lower expectations for the progress of a fall in inflation. The latest dot plot shows that the Fed currently expects to cut interest rates once this year, which is a significant hawkish turn compared to the March forecast. Powell also emphasized at the press conference that the Fed has no plans to cut interest rates and will continue to monitor more evidence to ensure that inflation is heading in the right direction. development in the expected direction. However, the U.S. CPI data for May released on June 12 showed that inflation fell further, supporting the market\'s renewed bets on interest rate cut expectations. Data show that the U.S. CPI increased by 3.3% year-on-year in May, slightly lower than the previous value and the expected value of 3.4%; after excluding food and energy costs, the core CPI in May increased by 3.4% year-on-year, which was lower than the expected 3.5% and lower than the previous value. 3.6%, the lowest level in more than three years",,,,
"Powell\'s hawkish statement that current inflation is still too high did not shake market confidence. May inflation data supported the rise in market risk appetite. As of the close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.85% and 1.53% respectively, while the Dow Jones fell slightly by 0.09%. The 10Y U.S. Treasury yield fell to 4.31%, 8 BBP lower than the previous trading day. Fedwatch interest rate path shows that the current market expects to start interest rate cuts in September this year, with an interest rate cut of 50 BP during the year, which is earlier than the expected start of interest rate cuts in November before the release of CPI data.",,,,
Economic forecasts and Powell\'s post-meeting remarks indicate that the progress of inflation is a core variable in the current Fed\'s decision-making.,,,,
"In terms of economic growth, compared with March, the economic forecast remains unchanged for 2024-2026 and longer-term economic growth expectations. The GDP growth forecast for 2024 remains at 2.1%, and the GDP growth forecast for 2025 and 2026 remains at 2.0%. Powell remained optimistic about the economic outlook at the press conference, and an economic soft landing remains the baseline scenario for the Federal Reserve\'s decision-making.",,,,
"In terms of employment, the economic forecast slightly raised the unemployment rate forecast, and the unemployment rate forecasts for 2025, 2026, and the long-term were all revised upward by 0.1 PCTS compared with March: the forecast for 2024 remained unchanged. At the press conference, Powell said various indicators indicate that labor market conditions have returned to pre-epidemic levels and are in a relatively tight but not overheated state. FOMC members believe that the current labor market performance is still strong, but has cooled down.",,,,
"In terms of inflation, economic forecasts have revised upwards the inflation and core inflation expectations of the past two years, indicating that the higher-than-expected inflation readings in the first quarter of this year have delayed the progress of the Fed\'s prediction of a fall in inflation, and also given the Fed the motivation to maintain inflation over a longer period of time. Keep interest rates high. Specifically, the June Economic Forecast raised its forecast for PCE inflation in 2024 to 2.6% from 2.4% in March, an upward revision of 0.2 PCTS. The forecast for core PCE inflation was raised to 2.8% from 2.6% in March, an upward revision of 0.2PCTS; Forecast for PCE inflation in 2025 was raised to 2.3% from 2.2% in March, an upward revision of 0.1PCTS. Forecast for core PCE inflation was raised to 2.3% from 2.2% in March, an upward revision of 0.1PCTS",,,,
"In terms of long-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve continued to raise its expectations for the long-term value of the federal funds rate from 2.6% to 2.8% after March. Powell said at the press conference that interest rates are unlikely to return to the """"very low"""" levels before the epidemic, but at the same time, Powell also hinted that long-term interest rates, as a """"theoretical concept"""" that cannot be directly observed, will have limited impact on short-term economic activities.",,,,
"In terms of interest rate path guidance, the latest dot plot shows that the Federal Reserve currently expects to cut interest rates once this year, which is a significant hawkish shift from the March forecast. The dot plot in March showed that 9 members believed that interest rates would be cut three times during the year. This time, no one expected interest rates to be cut three times, and 4 people expected that there would be no interest rate cuts during the year. The policy statement re-acknowledged the progress of inflation falling, but at the press conference, Powell said that inflation progress had stalled in the first quarter, which means that interest rate cuts will need to wait longer. The inflation data released so far this year is not enough to give the Federal Reserve the confidence to cut interest rates, and more data is needed to boost confidence.",,,,
"The path of the Fed\'s interest rate depends on the balance between two major goals: economic growth (full employment) and stable inflation. At this meeting, Powell admitted that after two years of high interest rate restrictions, inflation has slowed substantially and the Fed\'s employment and inflation goals have reached a better balance. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain, and the Federal Reserve is highly concerned about inflation risks. This shows that after experiencing repeated declines in inflation in the first quarter of 2024, the Federal Reserve has refocused its attention on the decline in inflation. This is different from the Fed\'s statement at the end of last year or even in March this year that it would balance the risk of economic recession in advance or start cutting interest rates to avoid excessive tightening. Looking forward, if the labor market continues to be resilient and the economic growth prospects are good, the Fed may have greater confidence to maintain high interest rates for a longer period of time to avoid prematurely reducing policy restrictions and causing a reversal of inflation progress. On the other hand, Powell also said that the Fed is also prepared to respond (start cutting interest rates) if the labor market weakens unexpectedly or inflation declines faster than expected. At this time of reversal, subsequent U.S. employment and inflation data may trigger market interest rate cut expectations and increase financial market performance volatility.",,,,

"Event: The United States added 150,000 new non-farm jobs in October, compared with a revised 297,000 from the previous value, and 180,000 expected; the unemployment rate was 3.9%, compared with an expected 3.8%, and the previous value of 3.8%. The labor force participation rate was 62.7%, compared with the previous value of 62.8%. Hourly wages increased by 0.2% month-on-month, compared with the previous value of 0.3%.",,,,
"Core view: In October, the labor demand side subsided, but the labor participation rate declined, and the supply and demand gap was unable to be repaired. The service industry, government, and construction industries are the main industries responsible for employment growth, while manufacturing employment has fallen sharply due to the strike. U.S. employment may be about to reach an inflection point that accelerates its decline, and the effects of monetary tightening are emerging. At present, the main line of trading in overseas markets still follows the Fed's monetary policy expectations. As employment further weakens in the future, we need to be wary of switching the main line of trading.",,,,
"The pace of repairing the labor supply-demand gap in the United States has slowed. From April to July this year, as employment demand in the United States cooled and supply repaired, the gap between supply and demand was quickly repaired. Since July, the supply side and the repair side have begun to rise and fall at the same time, and the repair speed of the supply and demand gap has slowed down. In October, both labor supply and demand weakened, and the gap between supply and demand was unable to be repaired. On the one hand, this is due to the reliability of the data. On the other hand, it also shows that the supply-side repair of U.S. employment may have peaked. The condition for the Federal Reserve to no longer raise interest rates is that tightening policy has a sustained inhibitory effect on the demand side.",,,,
"The service industry, government, and construction industries are the main industries responsible for employment growth, while manufacturing employment has fallen sharply due to the strike. Overall employment in the U.S. service industry remained strong in October, with 110,000 new jobs added. The number of new jobs in education and health services continues to remain high, with 89,000 in October. There are also more new jobs in the leisure and hotel industry and professional service industries. With continued fiscal easing, the government created 51,000 new jobs. Employment in the construction industry grew moderately as new housing inventories continued to expand as new housing inventories continued to expand. The manufacturing industry was affected by the UAW strike, and employment fell by 35,000 people. Employment in the transportation, warehousing and information industries both declined.",,,,
"U.S. employment may be about to reach an inflection point where its decline will accelerate. If the impact of the manufacturing strike is removed, although the non-farm payrolls in October were close to the expected level, they still fell significantly from the previous month. In October, the number of people engaged in part-time work due to economic reasons rose to 4.28 million, accounting for 13.8% of the previous value from 12.9%. The cumulative and lagging effects of monetary tightening are being transmitted to the job market, and the U.S. non-farm payrolls may be about to reach a weakening turning point.",,,,
"Wage growth was slower than expected. The average hourly wage of all employees in non-agricultural private enterprises increased by 0.2% seasonally adjusted month-on-month, which was lower than the previous value of 0.3%. In October, U.S. inflation is likely to accelerate its decline.",,,,
"You need to be wary of market transaction logic switching. The current main line of overseas market transactions still follows the Fed's monetary policy expectations. Despite weakening employment, the three major U.S. stock indexes collectively rose as the market lowered its valuation of the probability of a December interest rate hike, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.42%, the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 0.49%, and the S&P 500 Index rising 0.48%. The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell, while gold rose. The market still considers interest rate risk more than fundamental risk. In the coming months, as employment weakens further, fundamental risks will intensify and market trading logic may switch.",,,,
"It remains to be seen whether the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. Before the December FOMC meeting, the U.S. Bureau of Statistics will release November employment and inflation data. Whether the Fed will continue to raise interest rates still needs to be confirmed by employment and inflation data in November. In the past few months, the reliability of U.S. non-agricultural data has been highlighted. The preliminary non-agricultural data are often significantly adjusted, and household and business surveys are often contradictory. Although we believe that the weakening trend of US employment is accelerating, the initial value of November statistics may still exceed expectations. The U.S. unemployment rate still did not exceed 4% in October. If U.S. inflation strengthens, the current employment level is not weak enough and may not constitute a constraint for continuing to raise interest rates.",,,,

"The low base combined with the resilience of external demand has led to export growth exceeding expectations. Exports from January to February increased by 7.1% year-on-year, 4.8 percentage points higher than the end of last year (December 2023), and expected to be 2.7%. The higher-than-expected export growth rate is mainly affected by the following factors. First, the upward cycle of global semiconductor sales has provided support to china\'s exports of mechanical and electrical products; second, the United States has entered a replenishment cycle, bringing additional demand; third, economies such as ASEAN and the United States are still Resilience drives export numbers to improve. From a month-on-month perspective, the month-on-month decline from January to February was -9.8%, which was stronger than the average level of -20.4% from 2014 to 2023.",,,,

Among them, the U.S. manufacturing PMI in February was 52.2%, higher than the previous month. It rebounded by 1.5 percentage points from the previous month. The manufacturing boom in the Eurozone and Japan has improved marginally but is still weak, and the PMI index is below the boom-bust line. Overall, the strong resilience of the U.S. economy has played a certain supporting role in China\'s foreign demand. China\'s PMI new export orders in January and February were 46.7% and 46.4% respectively, slightly higher than in December 2023, indicating that manufacturing export demand has increased. Consistent with the fundamentals of overseas economies and the prosperity of the manufacturing industry, the growth rate of china\'s exports to ASEAN and the United States increased significantly from January to February compared with the previous period, and the decline in exports to the EU and Japan further expanded.

The automobile industry chain grew rapidly last year Under the influence of high technology, the export advantage continues. Mobile phone exports fell by 18.2%, and the decline expanded. However, the export volume increased by 12.8%. The decline in exports was mainly affected by falling prices. From the perspective of labor-intensive products, the recovery trend in December last year continued from January to February.

"Import growth exceeded expectations, and bulk commodities such as electronic products, iron ore, and crude oil performed well, mainly due to quantitative factors. Affected by the low base in the same period last year and the significant increase in imports of bulk commodities such as iron ore and crude oil, the import growth rate from January to February performed well, with a year-on-year increase of 3.5%. In terms of key imported commodities, the import value of high-tech products increased by 10.5 percentage points year-on-year to 11.9%, that of mechanical and electrical products increased by 5.5 percentage points to 7.7%, and that of agricultural products increased by 0.4 percentage points to -6.5%. Affected by the upward trend in the global semiconductor sales cycle, especially the increase in exports of china\'s consumer electronics-related products, the import growth rate of china\'s integrated circuits and other electronic industry chains rebounded significantly from January to February. Among them, the import growth rates of integrated circuits, diodes and similar semiconductor devices, computers and spare parts rebounded by 18.7, 22.9, and 39.9 percentage points respectively to 15.3%, 5.0%, and 67.3%; both the volume and price of coal and fertilizers fell, and the import value grew faster than Last month, they fell by 28.5 and 23 percentage points respectively to -5.1% and -4%.

"The base effect and the resilience of overseas demand may support exports to maintain positive growth, but the sustainability of the rebound in export growth still needs to be observed, and stabilizing foreign trade, stabilizing foreign investment, and expanding high-level opening up to the outside world still need to be implemented. The combination of low base effect and overseas demand is still resilient. Export growth in January and February exceeded expectations. Under the low base, export growth in 2024 may maintain positive growth. Looking forward, on the one hand, the high inflation in major economies such as Europe and the United States has been suppressed. In particular, the European economy is relatively weak and may be the first to enter the interest rate cut channel. There is room for stabilization in the global economy, and the external demand pressure faced by china\'s exports may be marginally improved. On the other hand, the policy of """"maintaining stability and improving quality"""" in the field of foreign trade has been continuously introduced, and the export structure has been continuously optimized, which may provide certain support for export growth. In terms of imports, the physical workload caused by the release of trillions of national debt will drive demand for related commodities. Domestic demand may continue to stabilize in the future, and there is support for import growth to remain stable, but the extent of domestic demand recovery still needs to be observed.

"Event: On November 27, the central bank released China’s monetary policy implementation report for the third quarter of 2023.",,,,
"Core point of view: As the first monetary policy implementation report after the financial work conference, the overall tone basically continues the spirit of the conference, and further explanations and details are given on revitalizing existing funds and improving use efficiency. Although there is no incremental information on real estate and local debt, we believe that it is still a key policy direction for consolidating the foundation of economic recovery. On the one hand, there is a high probability that the MLF will continue to exceed the quota in December, and on the other hand, it will decline. A quasi-rate cut is still possible. In the long term, money, credit and social financing will also develop in the direction of effective improvement in quality and reasonable growth in quantity.",,,,
"The judgment on the economic situation is optimistic. Regarding the judgment of the economic situation, it is more optimistic than in the second quarter. The central bank believes that there are more favorable factors for maintaining stable economic development, and the GDP growth rate in the third quarter is also better than market expectations. In terms of problems faced, compared with the """"external environment is complex and severe, and the domestic economic operation is also facing new difficulties and challenges"""" in the second quarter, """"the stable operation of the economy is also facing some internal and external challenges"""" are somewhat moderate. International risks are still mainly affected by the high interest rate environment, while domestic risks point directly to two major aspects: """"the effectiveness of debt-driven economic growth is reduced, and the relationship between real estate supply and demand has undergone major changes.""""",,,,

The tone of the monetary policy overall continues the spirit of the Financial Work Conference, emphasizing stability, precision, inter-cyclical and counter-cyclical adjustment, and dual adjustment of aggregate volume and structure to create a good monetary and financial environment. The same content as stated in the financial work conference also includes real estate, exchange rates, etc. However, for real estate, Column 1 emphasizes the synergy of interest rate policies, which is especially reflected in the reduction of first- and second-home loan interest rates and the reduction of existing mortgage interest rates to reduce residents\' interest expenses, thus boosting consumption.",,,,

"Strengthen monetary and fiscal coordination. Column 3 elaborates on strengthening the coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy. On the one hand, OMO and other tools can be used flexibly to smooth out the impact of daily fiscal revenue and expenditure; on the other hand, multiple channels, including RRR cuts, MLF, and OMO, can be used to make reasonable liquidity arrangements to support the centralized issuance of government bonds; on the other hand, policy coordination can play a role Functionality of Structural Tools. In terms of policy, policy coordination will continue to be strengthened in the future, and the institutional update and construction of the national debt market will also be accelerated.",,,,
"Support the development of private economy. Column 4 explains the monetary policy support for the private economy, including structural tools and broadening financing channels.

"The policy continues to be effective. This year, the central government has allocated 24.6 billion yuan to support agricultural machinery purchase and application subsidies, accelerate the implementation of scrapping and updating of agricultural machinery, and support the promotion and application of agricultural equipment.

"The """"Notice"""" clarifies that the objects of subsidies are farmers engaged in agricultural production and agricultural production and operation organizations. In terms of subsidy standards and fund arrangements, the central government\'s agricultural machinery scrapping and renewal subsidies are composed of two parts: scrapping partial subsidies and renewing partial subsidies. Among them, scrapping partial subsidies are subject to fixed subsidies, and the subsidy amount is determined by the provincial agricultural and rural departments in consultation with the financial department; renewal partial subsidies The standards are implemented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the agricultural machinery purchase and application subsidy policy.

"Risk warning: The risk of policy support being lower than expected, the risk of rapid technological iteration, and the risk of intensified market competition.",,,,
"Foreign side: In the first half of 2024, the economic trends of the United States and most non-U.S. developed countries gradually diverged, which also prompted differences in the monetary policy trends of the Federal Reserve and non-U.S. central banks. For the United States, although economic growth slowed down at the beginning of the year, consumer demand still showed a certain degree of resilience even as the labor market remained unbalanced. Therefore, the slowdown in price levels has gradually weakened without a significant reduction in residents\' income and expenditure, which has further led to inflation data frequently falling short of market expectations, and lingering concerns about inflation continue to hang over the entire market. Under this circumstance, the market has become more and more intense about the timing and intensity of the Fed\'s interest rate cuts this year. The expected first interest rate cut has been postponed from June at the beginning of the year to September, and the number of interest rate cuts during the year has been further reduced from three to less than two. At the same time, most non-U.S. countries are in sharp contrast to the United States. High interest rates have significantly suppressed economic growth and overall demand, thereby causing inflation to fall back to the normal range. This has also prompted non-U.S. central banks to gradually start an interest rate cutting cycle. In the future, the global economy may be boosted by the central bank\'s gradual relaxation of monetary policy, and the early recovery trend of the manufacturing industry may continue with the prospect of guaranteed demand.",,,,
"Domestic side: In the first half of the year, my country\'s economy continued to rebound and improve. As an important endogenous driving force for economic recovery, the manufacturing industry still has room for upside. From the investment side, real estate is still weak, while fiscal funds and projects are slow. Infrastructure growth has been significantly dragged down by special bonds, putting overall investment under pressure. However, it is expected to improve as the issuance of special bonds accelerates. In terms of foreign trade, overseas replenishment demand has boosted my country\'s exports to continue to rebound. Residents’ consumption patterns continue to change, and tourism consumption has become the main variable leading consumption growth. With the arrival of summer vacation, the growth rate of household consumption is expected to further increase, with the service industry still being the main contributor. In the first half of the year, financial data continued to differentiate the economic structure, with the pattern of """"strong manufacturing and weak real estate"""" remaining unchanged. The downturn in the property market and the early repayment of mortgage loans by residents have led to a decline in mid- and long-term loans for residents, preventing the idling of funds from significantly affecting corporate mid- and long-term loans. Looking forward to the second half of the year, the road to economic recovery will still be affected by many factors such as effective demand, externalities, price levels, and real estate prosperity. Considering that the effects of the real estate policy package have not yet been fully released, there is still considerable room for economic growth in the second half of the year.",,,,
"Fund performance: Non-bank easing, fund stratification disappears, and it is still continuing",,,,
"Since May, funds have continued to be loose, and funds have continued to be compressed. The easing of funds is mainly reflected in the layered relief. The R007-DR007 interest rate spread has dropped to close to 0bp. The weighted price center of inter-bank funds has not dropped significantly. DR007 has basically remained near the policy interest rate center of 1.8%, and the overnight price is not too high. Low, DR001 center continues to maintain around 1.75%. The net lending of major banks fluctuated at a low level, while the net lending of commodity funds and wealth management remained at a high level. The spontaneous loosening of funds mainly comes from abundant non-bank liquidity. Since April, bank financing outflows have continued to decline, while net financing outflows from commodity funds and financial management have increased significantly. From the perspective of demand, non-bank institutions have not been very willing to increase leverage since late April, and non-bank leverage ratios have continued to fall since April.",,,,
Historical comparison: Accommodation changed due to return of debt pressure and rebound in leverage demand,,,,
"From February to June 2021, there were also scenarios of non-bank easing and easing of fund stratification.",,,,
"There are certain similarities between the first half of 2021 and the present. Both have seen a decline in deposit growth but weak loan demand, low demand for debt market leverage, and loose liquidity driven by non-banks. The easing was modified by the return of debt pressure and the rebound in demand for leverage. The downward slope of loan growth has slowed, deposit growth has bottomed out, the high growth of non-bank deposits has come to an end, large banks\' lending has gradually resumed, and the proportion of non-bank lending has gradually declined; as monetary policy re-enters the easing cycle, the bond market The demand for leveraged financing began to pick up, non-bank financing gradually fell back, and the capital center returned to around the policy interest rate since it was significantly lower than the policy interest rate in the early period.",,,,
"Bank deposits: The momentum pressure may weaken at the end of this year’s quarter, but it will not completely disappear.",,,,
"At the end of the first half of the year, banks all showed strong """"deposit offset"""" characteristics. The momentum pressure may weaken at the end of this year\'s quarter, but it will not completely disappear. With recent adjustments to statistical methods and regulatory policies, banks may face less workload from deposits at the end of June than in previous years. However, under the pressure of indicator assessments, credit may still face a certain momentum pressure at the end of the quarter, which will also affect banks\' active liability needs and funding.",,,,
"The easing of fund stratification has a long-term nature, but we need to pay attention to possible fluctuations in June.",,,,
"Fund stratification relief has long-term nature. Regulatory tightening such as manual interest payment rectification is long-term. Banks will have fewer and fewer means of """"high interest rates to attract deposits"""". The price relationship between deposit interest rates and financial management yields will be straightened out, which also means that deposits will return to banks\' balance sheets. Lack of income drivers, changes in the financing structure and weakening of fund stratification are long-term.",,,,
"The easing of stratification does not mean that the financial stability will continue forever. Pay attention to the accumulation of volatile factors at the end of June. (1) The pressure on deposit momentum at the end of the first half of the year may be significantly alleviated compared to previous years, but seasonal assessments will still bring certain pressure on bank liabilities. (2) The net financing scale of government bonds in June may exceed one trillion. The supply of government bonds mainly absorbs the liquidity of major banks, thereby increasing the fluctuation of funding. (3) We look forward to the implementation of the RRR cut, but monetary easing will also bring about a rebound in demand for leveraged financing.",,,,
Liquidity tightened beyond expectations,,,,
"Global stock markets were mixed in June, with U.S. stocks and the Asia-Pacific region relatively strong. U.S. stocks Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Index rose 6.0%, 3.5% and 1.1% respectively; in the Asia-Pacific region, India\'s SENSEX30, South Korea\'s Composite Index and Nikkei 225 rose 6.9%, 6.1% and 2.8% respectively; in the European market Relatively weak, France\'s CAC40, Germany\'s DAX and Britain\'s FTSE 100 fell by 6.4%, 1.4% and 1.3% respectively.",,,,
"The fall in inflation is in line with expectations, and interest rate cut expectations may change. On June 28, the May reading of the PCE inflation indicator that the Federal Reserve is most concerned about was announced. The U.S. core PCE in May was 2.6% year-on-year, in line with expectations, a new low in more than three years; the month-on-month 0.1% was also in line with expectations, a new low since the beginning of the year. In addition to the fall in inflation data, other economic data show signs that the U.S. economy is peaking and weakening, and there is a clear differentiation between the service industry and the manufacturing industry. In terms of employment and orders, the manufacturing industry is relatively more resilient; while the service industry is relatively more resilient. The industry is more affected by price factors. After the PCE was released, the Chicago PMI was released in June, with a reading of 47.4, higher than the forecast value of 40.0; the final value of the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index in June was 68.2, higher than the expected value of 65.8 and the previous value of 65.6. U.S. bond interest rates have risen, and the long-term rise has been significantly larger. The 2Y interest rate rebounded to 4.77%, and the 10Y interest rate rose to around 4.41%. However, CME shows that interest rate cut expectations have increased. September interest rate cut expectations have climbed slightly from 63% in early June to the current 68%. The probability of two interest rate cuts during the year has climbed from 44% in early June to the current 71% level. Mainly This is due to the smooth decline in inflation and the increased probability of a weakening outlook due to divergent economic data.",,,,
"Elections in Europe and the United States are becoming more and more intense, and there may be a third scenario in the U.S. election. A month ago, Trump\'s guilty verdict was still a hot topic in public opinion.

A month later, the conflict between Biden and Trump After the first round of TV debates in the general election, the situation reversed. Trump\'s electoral advantage was consolidated, and pressure came to the Democratic Party and Biden. There are already many voices among Democratic supporters saying that Biden is no longer suitable to continue to run and that another candidate needs to be selected to compete with Republican Trump before the party convention in August. In other words, after the first round of debates, the probability of the third scenario in the US election cannot be ignored.

Recently released economic data indicate that the current U.S. economic performance may not be strong, but the Federal Reserve continues to remain cautious about cutting interest rates. The U.S.'s recent tendency to maintain high interest rates for a longer period of time will put some pressure on the gold market.",,,,
"In the long term, gold still presents good investment opportunities. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is expected to shift, and there is room for downside in long-term U.S. bond interest rates during the interest rate cut cycle, and the gold price center is expected to continue to rise. In addition, against the background of the central bank's continued gold purchases and frequent global risk events, gold has strong allocation value.

"On May 31, China’s Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for May was announced, with the manufacturing PMI being 49.5 (-0.7pct month-on-month) and the non-manufacturing PMI being 51.1 (month-on-month -0.1pct).",,,,
"Conclusion: The PMI performance in May was mediocre, the overall trend was weaker than the same period in previous years, and the momentum has declined compared with the beginning of the year. It shows that although the economy has made restorative progress, its foundation is still not solid, and structural contradictions in the transformation are still prominent. Generally speaking, the manufacturing industry is """"weak in supply and demand"""", the non-manufacturing industry is """"structurally differentiated"""", and the consumer services industry has become the """"stabilizer"""" of the economy.",,,,
"Specifically, the May PMI has the following characteristics:",,,,
"A comprehensive fall in demand is a core feature of this month\'s data. Insufficient demand has led to a significant decline in production, and the gap between production and demand has narrowed. From an absolute level, production is still in the expansion range (50.8), but the """"three major demands"""": new orders (-1.5pct to 49.6), new export orders (-2.3pct to 48.3) and orders on hand (-0.3pct to 45.3) have fallen back to the contraction range.",,,,
"Inventory pressure fell, and costs pushed price indicators back up. In terms of inventories, as production slows down, inventories of finished goods and raw materials decline simultaneously. At the same time, price indicators recovered significantly, driven mainly by rising costs. The trend of bulk commodities has diverged. Non-ferrous metal and oil prices have fallen. However, the prices of agricultural, sideline, food and real estate chain-related raw materials have increased, driving input prices to rise sharply by 2.9pct to 56.9; ex-factory prices have also rebounded under cost pressure (+1.3pct to 56.9). 50.4), returning above the boom-bust line for the first time since September last year. It is worth reminding that when demand is insufficient, cost-driven price increases may cause two problems: First, companies cannot successfully transfer costs to consumers, leading to a worsening of the """"output-input gap"""" and suppressing corporate profits and future prospects. Willingness to expand production; second, passive upward price increases on the consumer side may further suppress demand.",,,,
"The performance of the non-manufacturing industry was weaker than that of the same period before the epidemic (2017-2019), mainly dragged down by the construction industry. The service PMI has stabilized (+0.2pct to 50.5), but the structure is differentiated, and the roles of producer services and consumer services have reversed. In terms of the construction industry, the month-on-month figure was -1.9pct to 54.4, supported by expectations for improvement in the real estate industry, and dragged down by the slow progress of government-led projects such as infrastructure: the housing construction industry (+0.4pct to 51.7) provided support, and civil engineering (-5.5pct to 51.7) 58.2), construction, installation, decoration and other construction industries (-1.0pct to 54.4) formed a drag.",,,,
"The manufacturing PMI showed a super-seasonal decline in May, breaking through the boom-bust line downwards. The PMI fell 0.9pct month-on-month to 49.5, falling out of the expansion range that had been in place for two months. From a seasonal perspective, the decline in manufacturing prosperity in May was significantly greater than the pre-epidemic level and the level in recent years: -0.17pct month-on-month in the same period from 2017 to 2019, -0.23pct month-on-month in the same period from 2020-2023 (excluding 2022), so the decline cannot be complete Explain with seasonality. In terms of contribution factors, the main drag on this period\'s data comes from production (contribution -0.525pct) and new orders (contribution -0.45pct), and the main contribution comes from distribution (contribution 0.045pct).",,,,
"A comprehensive fall in demand is the core feature of this month\'s data. Insufficient demand has led to a significant decline in production, and the gap between production and demand has narrowed. From the perspective of relative changes, production demand has weakened simultaneously, and the """"production-demand gap"""" has narrowed: on the one hand, new orders continue to shrink (-1.5pct), on the other hand, after the order peak, production declined significantly (-2.1pct), The """"production-demand gap"""" correspondingly narrowed by 0.6pct to 1.2pct. From an absolute level, production is still in the expansion range (50.8), but the """"three major demands"""": new orders (49.6), new export orders (-2.3pct to 48.3) and orders on hand (-0.3pct to 45.3) have all fell back into contraction territory.",,,,
"Inventory pressure fell, and costs pushed price indicators back up. In terms of inventory, as corporate production slows down, inventories of finished products and raw materials decline simultaneously. At the same time, price indicators recovered significantly, driven mainly by rising costs. The trend of bulk commodities has diverged. Non-ferrous metal and oil prices have fallen. However, the prices of agricultural, sideline, food and real estate chain-related raw materials have increased, driving input prices to rise sharply by 2.9pct to 56.9; ex-factory prices have also rebounded under cost pressure (+1.3pct to 56.9). 50.4), returning above the boom-bust line for the first time since September last year. It is worth reminding that when demand is insufficient, price increases driven by rising costs may cause two problems: First, companies cannot successfully transfer costs to consumers, leading to a worsening of the """"output-input gap"""" and suppressing corporate profits and Willingness to expand production in the future; second, passive upward price increases on the consumer side may further suppress demand. In terms of supply chain, the delivery timeliness fell slightly (-0.3pct to 50.1), which pushed the PMI in the opposite direction.",,,,
"Based on the above factors, the manufacturing industry is expected to continue to fall, and the prosperity of small businesses has declined significantly. In terms of expectations, as production and demand weaken simultaneously, manufacturing expectations have fallen for two consecutive months (-0.9pct to 54.3). In terms of size, the PMIs of enterprises of different sizes are obviously differentiated. Large enterprises are relatively stable, and their prosperity is rising against the trend (+0.4pct to 50.7); small and medium-sized enterprises have dropped significantly (medium-sized -1.3pct to 49.4, small-sized -3.6pct to 46.7). The """"difference between large and small enterprises"""" jumped from 0pct to 4pct. In terms of industries, 8 (50%) of the 16 industries are in the prosperous range. The performance of equipment (special equipment, general equipment, electrical machinery), chemicals (chemical fibers, chemical raw materials) and pharmaceuticals (pharmaceutical manufacturing) better.",,,,
"The Federal Reserve\'s interest rate meeting in June announced that it would maintain the target range of the federal benchmark interest rate at 5.25%-5.5%.

"1. This interest rate meeting is the seventh consecutive time that the Federal Reserve has suspended interest rate increases since September 2023, which is in line with market expectations. The dot plot in June raised the end point of the interest rate in 2024 to 4.9-5.4% (expected to be 4.4-5.4% in March), and at the same time raised the interest rate in 2025 to 4.1% (expected to be 3.9% in March), keeping the interest rate in 2026 at 3.1%. . With each rate cut expected to be 25bp, the Federal Reserve may only cut interest rates once in 2024, while the number of rate cuts expected at the beginning of the year was 3. This interest rate forecast is obviously hawkish.",,,,
"2. Compared with the May meeting, the statement of this meeting has little change, mainly adding the statement that """"inflation has made moderate progress toward the 2% target in recent months."""" Powell\'s speech after the press conference stated that although inflation is currently high, it has slowed substantially. Although the labor market is strong, it is also showing signs of cooling. However, the performance in May alone is not enough to support an interest rate cut. He reiterated that when the Fed first cut interest rates, The selection of points will also require continued observation of inflation and employment data.",,,,
3. This meeting released the latest economic forecast dot plot:,,,,
"The U.S. GDP growth forecast for the next three years remains unchanged. Among them, GDP growth is expected to be 2.1% in 2024, 2% in 2025, and 2% in 2026.",,,,
"The unemployment rate forecast for 2025 and 2026 is slightly raised, while the unemployment rate forecast for 2024 remains unchanged. Among them, the unemployment rate is expected to be 4% in 2024, 4.2% in 2025 (4.1% expected in March), and 4.1% in 2026 (4% expected in March).",,,,
"The inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025 were raised, while the inflation expectations for 2026 were kept unchanged. Among them, the inflation expectation in 2024 is 2.6% (2.4% expected in March), the inflation expectation in 2025 is 2.3% (2.2% expected in March), and the inflation expectation in 2026 remains unchanged at 2%.",,,,
"The core inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025 are raised, while the core inflation expectations for 2026 are kept unchanged. Among them, the inflation expectation in 2024 is 2.8% (2.6% expected in March), the core inflation expectation in 2025 is 2.3% (2.2% expected in March), and the core inflation expectation in 2026 remains unchanged at 2%.",,,,
"4. Although this meeting lowered the number of interest rate cuts throughout the year and was generally hawkish, it was basically in line with market expectations. In addition, the previously announced year-on-year and month-on-month growth of the U.S. CPI and core CPI in May were lower than the previous values \u200b\u200band market expectations. Financial markets continued to trade interest rate cut expectations after the meeting. Among them, the Nasdaq and S&P indexes in the United States both hit record highs, the price of gold and the U.S. dollar index both fell rapidly and then rose, and the 10-year U.S. bond yield remained fluctuating around 4.3%.",,,,
"The CME Exchange currently predicts that the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in July remains at 8%, while the probability of a September interest rate cut has increased significantly to 63%, and the probability of a November interest rate cut has increased to 76%. We maintain our judgment that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the first time in September and cut interest rates twice this year. If there are rapid changes in employment or inflation data, a single interest rate cut of 25bp or 50bp is possible, and the annual rate cut will be slightly reduced to 50-75bp.",,,,
5. Our judgment on the future price trends of major asset classes is:,,,,
U.S. stocks have hit record highs recently and are expected to remain high and volatile until interest rate cuts are implemented.,,,,
"As the European Central Bank begins to cut interest rates, it is expected that the U.S. dollar index will still maintain strong fluctuations above 105 in the short term, and there is a high probability of returning to the 100-105 range in the medium term.",,,,
"We maintain our judgment that the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has peaked, and it is difficult to sustain above 4.4%, and it is expected to fluctuate around 4.2% in the short term.",,,,
"The probability of gold prices reaching new highs in the short term is unlikely and is expected to fluctuate around a high of $2,300 per ounce.",,,,

The relevant person in charge of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage accepted an exclusive interview with reporters on the relevant situation:",,,,
"Question: What is the background of the """"Opinions""""?",,,,
"Answer: Scientific and technological innovation is the first driving force for the high-quality development of cultural relics undertakings. General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to use advanced technology to strengthen the protection and research of cultural relics. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, cultural relics authorities at all levels have vigorously promoted scientific and technological development in the field of cultural relics, strengthened top-level design and strategic planning, and actively sought support from various national science and technology plans. Cultural relics science and technology The innovation ability and level have been significantly improved, which has effectively promoted the protection, research, management and utilization of cultural relics. However, due to its late start and weak foundation, scientific and technological work in the field of cultural relics still has multiple shortcomings. Compared with the international cultural heritage powers and compared with other fields, the overall level is relatively backward and the scientific and technological innovation capabilities are insufficient, making it difficult to carry out high-level contributions to cultural relics undertakings. Provide effective support for quality development.",,,,
"In order to implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Party and Xi Jinping’s cultural thoughts, implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important expositions on cultural relics work and scientific and technological innovation, and give full play to the supporting and leading role of science and technology in the development of cultural relics, on the basis of early in-depth research, we drafted The """"Opinions on Strengthening Scientific and Technological Innovation in Cultural Relics"""" was jointly issued by 13 departments including the Central Propaganda Department after being reviewed and approved by the Central Committee for Deepening Reform. The """"Opinions"""" aim to solve the institutional problems that restrict the innovation of cultural relics science and technology, strengthen the shortcomings of cultural relics science and technology, and support and lead the sustainable development of cultural relics undertakings. It is divided into six parts: overall requirements, optimizing the layout of cultural relics science and technology innovation, building a strong cultural relics science and technology innovation platform, strengthening the cultural relics science and technology innovation talent team, improving the incentive mechanism for cultural relics science and technology innovation, and implementing guarantees.",,,,
"Question: What are the basic principles and main objectives of the """"Opinions""""?",,,,
"Answer: The """"Opinions"""" combine the current status and trends of scientific and technological development in the field of cultural relics and clarify the basic principles of """"highlighting key points, building a solid foundation, people-oriented, and reform and innovation"""". By 2025, focus on building a number of national and regional cultural relics scientific research institutions, forming a scientific research talent echelon with stable scientific research directions and reasonable structures, breaking through a number of key technologies for cultural relics protection and archaeology in key areas, and forming a number of systematic solutions. By 2035, establish a cultural relics science and technology innovation network that is interdisciplinary and cross-industry with effective division of labor and cooperation, build a basic cultural relics science and technology platform system and a shared service mechanism, and form a systematic theory, method and technology of cultural relics science and technology innovation with Chinese characteristics.",,,,
"Question: What are the main contents of the """"Opinions""""?",,,,
"Answer: The """"Opinions"""" adhere to the combination of goal orientation and problem orientation, focus on the implementation of the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education, the strategy of strengthening the country with talents, and the strategy of innovation-driven development, focusing on the overall goal of building a culturally powerful country and promoting the high-quality development of cultural relics undertakings, aiming at the effective supply of cultural relics science and technology in china. Problems such as inadequacy, small and scattered cultural relics scientific research institutions, serious shortage of scientific and technological talents, unbalanced allocation of scientific and technological resources, and unsound scientific and technological management systems and mechanisms should be addressed from optimizing the layout of cultural relics scientific and technological innovation, building a strong cultural relics scientific and technological innovation platform, and strengthening the cultural relics scientific and technological innovation talent team. Systematic arrangements were made in four aspects, including improving cultural relics science and technology innovation incentive mechanisms, and a total of 16 measures were put forward.",,,,
Q: What are the specific work arrangements for optimizing the layout of technological innovation?,,,,
"Answer: The """"Opinions"""" focus on the major needs for the protection and utilization of cultural relics, including basic research and applied basic research in the field of cultural relics, key technology research, upgrading of special equipment for cultural relics, deepening research on major archaeological topics, transformation and application of scientific and technological achievements, and standardization construction in the field of cultural relics. Task deployment was carried out. Focus on building a theoretical system for the protection and utilization of cultural relics with Chinese characteristics, strengthen the research and development and system integration of common key technologies, break through a number of key equipment, devices, software systems and special materials, vigorously develop archaeological methods and technologies, and coordinate the implementation of joint research and development of industry, academia, research and application.

Strengthen international scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, and coordinate the promotion of international academic exchanges, scientific research cooperation, talent training and institutional construction of cultural heritage.",,,,
Q: What are the specific work arrangements for strengthening the talent team?,,,,
"Answer: The """"Opinions"""" coordinate the cultivation and use of talents to strengthen the construction of cultural relics science and technology talent teams. On the one hand, through measures such as building disciplines and majors, expanding enrollment, and improving training mechanisms, we will strengthen the reserve of scientific research talents and focus on the discovery and training of strategic scientists and leading scientific research talents, as well as the construction of innovative teams. For example, continue to implement the """"Support Action for Outstanding Youth in Cultural Relics""""; promote the construction of disciplines related to cultural relics science and technology, and increase the training of cultural relics science and technology talents that intersect liberal arts and science. On the other hand, we should optimize the job structure of cultural relics institutions, solve the problems of insufficient capacity of scientific and technological talents and unreasonable talent structure in the cultural relics industry, and comprehensively improve the scale and quality of cultural relics scientific and technological talents.",,,,
Q: What specific work arrangements are there to improve the incentive mechanism?,,,,
"Answer: The """"Opinions"""" focus on issues such as the backward scientific research management system of cultural and museum units, insufficient scientific and technological rewards and incentives, and insufficient corporate participation in innovation. It focuses on optimizing and improving the scientific research management regulations of cultural and museum units, implementing scientific and technological innovation incentive and reward policies, and improving corporate technological innovation incentive mechanisms. In terms of promoting the implementation of relevant scientific and technological innovation policies in the cultural relics industry. For example, cultural and museum units that undertake national-level scientific research tasks enjoy the same policies as scientific research institutions in terms of management and use of scientific research funds and scientific research personnel going abroad on official business; some pilot research-based cultural and museum units enjoy cash reward policies for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.",,,,
"Main data: From January to September 2023, the national general public budget revenue was 16.67 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of 8.9% (previous value: 10%), but the actual year-on-year growth rate after excluding the factor of retained tax refunds was -2.5% ( Previous value: -2.5%). General public budget expenditures totaled 19.78 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of 3.9% (previous value: 3.8%). From January to September, the national government fund budget revenue totaled 3.39 trillion yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of -15.0% (previous value: -15.0%), and government fund budget expenditures totaled 572 million yuan, with a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of -21.7 % (previous value: -21.7%).",,,,
"1. The general public budget revenue and expenditure progress has improved, and fiscal expenditures have increased significantly, mainly due to the rebound in the growth rate of infrastructure-related expenditures. General public budget revenue in September recorded 1.4 trillion yuan, an increase of 245.5 billion yuan from the previous month. The year-on-year growth rate was -1.26%, an increase of 3.3 percentage points from the previous month. The revenue side has stabilized and rebounded. The full-year revenue completion progress is 75%. Although Slightly lower than the average over the past five years, but 72% higher than the same period last year. General public budget expenditures were 2.6 trillion yuan, an increase of 675.6 billion yuan from the previous month. The expenditure side continued to exert strength. In September, fiscal expenditure intensity was 118.7%, higher than the average of 112% over the past five years. Among them, the growth rate of infrastructure-related transportation and agriculture, forestry and water affairs expenditures increased significantly, driving the cumulative growth rate of infrastructure expenditures throughout the year to increase by 1.4 percentage points, playing an important supporting role in the recovery of demand in the third quarter.",,,,
"2. The rebound in the growth rate of multiple tax revenues confirms the current economic recovery trajectory, that is, demand recovery takes the lead and gradually leads to production recovery. The economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, mainly reflected in the recovery of the demand side, which was confirmed by the tax data in September. Among them, the consumption tax increased significantly by 31 percentage points year-on-year that month, the corporate income tax increased by 20 percentage points from negative to positive, and the vehicle purchase tax continued to increase at a high rate, all of which reflected a sharp rebound from household consumption to corporate profits. Driven by the rebound in demand, the year-on-year growth rate of enterprise value-added tax, which reflects the production and processing links, increased slightly by 0.13 percentage points. It shows that driven by demand, corporate production is also showing signs of speeding up, which cross-confirms the current economic recovery with certainty with September\'s PPI and inventory data.",,,,
"3. As the issuance of special bonds accelerated, the growth rate of broad fiscal revenue and expenditure deviated significantly, and the land market showed signs of stabilization. The National People\'s Congress meeting in August significantly accelerated the issuance and use of special bonds. In September, government fund expenditures were 915 billion yuan, a year-on-year growth of 26.14%, while the revenue side was only 470.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 20.44%. It was still mainly driven by land revenue. Impact. The cumulative revenue from land sales from January to September was 3.85 trillion yuan, a decrease of 28.3% compared with the same period last year. Judging from high-frequency data, real estate sales and new construction starts have stabilized. In terms of the land market, the absolute values \u200b\u200bof land value-added tax, urban land use tax and cultivated land occupation tax have all rebounded. However, we believe that even if the primary land market stops falling and stabilizes, it will be difficult to rebound significantly in the short term. There is a high probability that government fund revenue will not be collected this year. Without considering the transfer of funds at the end of the year, we estimate that the completion of government funds throughout the year The progress is about 85%, and the corresponding outstanding amount is about 1.1 trillion.",,,,
"4. The """"trillion in national debt"""" and """"advance release"""" extension policies will provide strong support for fiscal expenditures in the fourth quarter and next year. On October 24, the National People\'s Congress approved the addition of one trillion yuan in national debt, and also approved the extension of the mechanism for early release of local government debt quotas to 2027. Among them, the newly added national debt can just make up for part of the decline in government fund revenue this year. Taking into account the redundancy left in the budget formulation at the beginning of the year, against the backdrop of fiscal intensification in the fourth quarter, the annual economic growth rate is higher than the established target of 5%. becomes a high probability event. At the same time, the early release of local debt quotas and the 500 billion yuan of new debt quotas reserved for next year can better connect the policies between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, and maintain the continuous strengthening of policies to better support the economy. Expected continued improvement.",,,,
Confidence in economic prospects remains stable,,,,

Compared with last month\'s expectations, the change in the median annual economic growth forecast for 2024-2026 shows an """"rising-flat-flat"""" pattern, indicating that the market\'s overall confidence in the economic outlook is stable and warm. Market expectations for a stable economy in the medium and long term have not changed, and short-term recovery is still the mainstream market view. Judging from the expectations of economic growth drivers, the median market expectations for the future 4Q consumption growth are mixed, with short-term declines; judging from the expected median changes in the investment growth rate, the first economic growth driver, the expected median values \u200b\u200bfor the future 4Q are all higher than The decline in the previous period indicates that the market\'s overall confidence in short-term economic development has declined; foreign trade expectations are overall on the warmer side. Judging from the change in the median growth forecast of the """"troika"""", we believe that the market consensus that the economy is stable and moderately warm remains unchanged.",,,,
"Inflation expectations pick up, currency expectations remain stable",,,,
"Judging from the median change in price market expectations, the easing of deflation and the continuation of the """"scissors gap"""" between industrial products and consumer goods are still the mainstream market views: Compared with the previous month, the market\'s median expectations for the CPI growth rate in the future 4Q this month are mixed. , the expectation of an upward trend remains unchanged; the expected changes in PPI are also basically consistent. The expected median changes for this month in the next 4Q will be """"fall, fall, flat, rise"""". The market believes that the shrinkage of industrial product prices will be delayed until 1Q. We still believe that as China\'s economy continues to """"hover at the bottom"""", China\'s inflation will continue to be sluggish, and PPI will continue to shrink for 2-3 quarters; China\'s continued price slump is not deflation in the traditional economic cycle sense, but transformation It is a unique phenomenon under the changes in industrial structure during the period and is a statistical phenomenon brought about by the base effect under stable price trends. Market expectations for the monetary environment (monetary growth, RRR, policy interest rates) are generally stable, with the interest rate curve remaining unchanged. Stable market interest rates have become the mainstream market expectation for the current period, indicating that the market\'s expectations for stable and loose monetary policy remain unchanged.",,,,
Economic confidence is stable and the market remains stable,,,,
"Regarding the probability that China\'s economy will fall into recession within the next 12 months, 12 economists gave a median estimate of 13%. Compared with previous expectations, the market\'s confidence in the economic outlook remains unchanged. Regarding expectations for changes in the monetary policy environment, expectations for interest rate cuts and reserve requirement ratio cuts in 2024H2 still exist. The market interest rate curve is highly expected to be stable, which means that the capital market valuation center will remain stable.",,,,
"Taken together, interest rate expectations, which have an important impact on the valuation center of the capital market, have stabilized. We believe that with the recovery of market confidence brought about by the stabilization and recovery of the economy, and the stabilization of market interest rates due to the continuation of stable monetary easing, China The capital market will usher in a trend of stabilization and recovery amid fluctuations.",,,,
"Conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East have expanded, and the international financial situation has changed; China\'s inflation has risen beyond expectations, and China\'s monetary policy has changed beyond expectations.",,,,
"Expert Interpretation One | In-depth implementation of special actions for energy conservation and carbon reduction to promote green, low-carbon and high-quality development of the steel industry Release time: 2024/06/07 Source: Department of Environmental Protection [Print] The steel industry is an important basic industry for the national economy and an important step in building modernization important support for a powerful country.

(3) Promoting energy conservation and carbon reduction in the steel industry is an important support for completing the energy conservation and carbon reduction goals of the “14th Five-Year Plan”. my country is a major steel producer and consumer, and the steel industry is a key industry in my country's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.. In 2023, the total energy consumption of my country's steel industry will account for more than 11% of the country's total energy consumption. There are still about 15% of crude steel production capacity whose energy efficiency does not reach the benchmark level.. Actively promoting energy conservation and carbon reduction actions in the steel industry, ensuring the entry points for new projects, and implementing energy conservation and carbon reduction transformation of existing projects are of great significance to support the completion of the energy conservation and carbon reduction goals of the """"14th Five-Year Plan"""". 2. Systematically deploy key tasks for energy conservation and carbon reduction in the steel industry. In order to accelerate energy conservation and carbon reduction in the steel industry, the Action Plan proposes seven key tasks.. First, strengthen production capacity regulation and output management. Focusing on deepening the supply-side structural reform as the main line, we put forward specific requirements for improving steel production capacity regulation and output management.. Crude steel output regulation will continue to be implemented in 2024. By the end of 2025, the proportion of production capacity above the industry's energy efficiency benchmark level will reach 30%, and the production capacity below the energy efficiency benchmark level will complete the target tasks of technological transformation or elimination.. The second is to strengthen the source control of new projects. Strengthen the energy-saving review and environmental assessment approval of fixed asset investment projects, comprehensively improve the energy efficiency and environmental protection level of new construction, reconstruction and expansion projects, and resolutely suspend the approval and construction of steel projects that do not meet the requirements.. The third is to accelerate energy-saving and carbon-reducing transformation and upgrading.

At the same time, the """"Action Plan"""" further strengthens policy funding and other safeguard measures to help the green, low-carbon and high-quality development of the steel industry. First, strengthen incentives and constraints. Based on energy efficiency levels and environmental protection performance, differentiated incentive and restraint mechanisms such as output regulation, transformation and upgrading, and stepped electricity prices will be implemented for enterprises in a hierarchical and classified manner.. The second is to increase financial support. Comprehensive use of government investment, tax incentives, green finance, transformation finance and other means to increase support for energy-saving and carbon-reducing transformation and energy-using equipment renewal projects in the steel industry. The third is to promote the improvement of standards. Accelerate the revision of relevant energy consumption limit standards, promote the formulation of carbon emission accounting, low-carbon process technology and other standards, formulate and revise recommended standards such as energy efficiency benchmarking guidelines for key processes and energy efficiency benchmark assessment specifications, and effectively use standards as a guide to promote energy conservation and carbon reduction in the industry.. The fourth is to accelerate technological innovation. Improve the insurance policy for the first (set) of major technical equipment and the first application of key new materials, and support enterprises to increase investment in research and development of advanced process equipment and other equipment.. Encourage industry associations to regularly collect and publish relevant technology lists, and accelerate the promotion and application of advanced energy-saving and carbon-reducing technologies.. 3. Effectively strengthen the organization and implementation of energy conservation and carbon reduction work in the steel industry. In order to promote the organization and implementation of all regions and relevant parties and ensure the implementation of various key tasks, the """"Action Plan"""" provides for strengthening organizational leadership, accelerating project implementation, and strict supervision and management. , strengthen publicity and guidance, and put forward work requirements. First, strengthen organization and leadership. All regions are required to refine work measures, decompose tasks, and consolidate responsibilities based on actual conditions.. Give full play to the role of industry associations and research institutions to strengthen service guidance for steel companies. The second is to speed up project implementation.

"The real estate market-oriented reform and the rapid urbanization process in the 1990s generated a large demand for housing and drove the rapid development of the real estate market. Real estate-related taxes and land transfer income continued to increase at a high rate. After more than 20 years of development, “land finance” has become an important source of fiscal revenue for local governments.",,,,
"However, in recent years, with the reversal of the real estate supply and demand situation, the downturn in the commercial housing market has continued to impact the land market. Combined with residents\' lack of confidence in purchasing houses, real estate companies\' cash flow deviations, and private companies\' low willingness to acquire land, it has directly affected the land transfer income of local governments, further aggravating the situation. Local financial constraints have arisen. In 2023, the national land transfer revenue was 5,799.6 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 13.2%, and the decline for two consecutive years has impacted the available financial resources of local governments and attracted market attention. This article sorts out the changing characteristics of land transfer revenue rankings by province from 1998 to 2023, and further explores the future direction of land finance. (You can refer to the previous reports """"Clarifying Five Cognitive Misunderstandings of Land Finance"""" """"The Land Market Cools, Where Will Land Finance Go?"""" """"The Tax Sharing System is Not the Reason for Land Finance, Performance Assessment is"""" """"What is Equity Finance? Can it Be?"""" Replace land finance?"""")",,,,
"In terms of revenue scale, the top ten provinces in land transfer revenue in 2023 are: Jiangsu (948.2 billion yuan), Zhejiang (647 billion yuan), Shandong (415.6 billion yuan), Sichuan (395.2 billion yuan), Guangdong (381.8 billion yuan) yuan), Shanghai (319.7 billion yuan), Hubei (230.7 billion yuan), Hunan (228.3 billion yuan), Anhui (208.5 billion yuan), and Beijing (194.7 billion yuan). From the perspective of revenue growth, 22 of the 28 provinces that have released data will experience negative growth in land transfer revenue in 2023. Downward pressure on the land market in the southeastern coastal economic provinces has increased, with land transfer revenue declining year-on-year in Fujian (-23.0%), Zhejiang (-22.4%), Guangdong (-18.2%), Shanghai (-15.9%), and Jiangsu (-11.3%) larger. The total land transfer revenue of the 10 provinces and cities in the eastern region will decrease by 15.4% year-on-year in 2023, but its total amount will reach 3,383.1 billion yuan, still accounting for 58.3% of the national land transfer revenue. The pattern of land transfer revenue concentrated in the eastern region has not changed.",,,,
"Risk warning: The real estate downturn has dragged down land transfer income; the 2023 land transfer income data of some provinces has not yet been disclosed, which may have a certain impact on the ranking; the statistical caliber of the Land and Resources Yearbook data is different from that of the financial department.",,,,

"Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th: Title: Opening up a new legal situation in carbon emissions trading - Interpretation of the """"Interim Regulations on the Management of Carbon Emissions Trading""""",,,,
Xinhua News Agency reporters Gao Jing and Qi Qi,,,,
"The """"Interim Regulations on Carbon Emissions Trading Management"""" were recently announced and will come into effect on May 1, 2024. How will this regulation regulate the development of the carbon market? Relevant persons in charge of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment interpreted the regulations.",,,,
"Carbon emissions trading is an important policy tool to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide through market mechanisms, and to help actively and steadily promote carbon peak and carbon neutrality.",,,,
"Relevant persons in charge of the two departments introduced that in recent years, the construction of china\'s carbon emissions trading market has been steadily advancing. In July 2021, the national carbon emissions trading market will be launched online. Since the launch of online trading, the national carbon emissions trading market has been operating smoothly overall, covering an average annual carbon dioxide emissions of about 5.1 billion tons, accounting for more than 40% of the country\'s total emissions. As of the end of 2023, the national carbon emissions trading market has included a total of 2,257 power generation companies, with a cumulative transaction volume of approximately 440 million tons and a transaction volume of approximately 24.9 billion yuan. The policy effects of carbon emissions trading have initially emerged.",,,,
"At the same time, shortcomings in the construction of the national carbon emissions trading market system have become increasingly apparent. Previously, there were no laws or administrative regulations on the management of carbon emissions trading in china. The operation and management of the national carbon emissions trading market was based on the regulations and documents of the relevant departments of the State Council. The legislation was of a low level and lacked authority, making it difficult to regulate trading activities and For practical needs such as ensuring data quality and punishing illegal acts, special administrative regulations need to be formulated to provide a clear legal basis for the operation and management of the national carbon emissions trading market and to ensure and promote its healthy development.",,,,
"The formulation of the regulations summarizes practical experience, adheres to full-process management, covers all major aspects of carbon emissions trading, and avoids gaps and blind spots in the system. At the same time, based on the actual situation that china\'s carbon emissions trading is generally a new thing and is still being explored, the focus is on building a basic institutional framework, maintaining the necessary flexibility in relevant institutional design, and leaving room for future development. In addition, in response to the prominent problem of falsification of carbon emission data, efforts have been made to improve the system and mechanism, effectively prevent and punish, and ensure that the carbon emissions trading policy functions.",,,,
"Relevant persons in charge of the two departments said that the regulations construct the basic institutional framework for carbon emissions trading management from six aspects: First, the legal status and responsibilities of registration agencies and trading agencies. The second is the coverage of carbon emissions trading as well as trading products, trading entities and trading methods. The third is to determine the key emission units. The fourth is carbon emission quota allocation. The fifth is the preparation and verification of emission reports. Sixth, carbon emission quota settlement and market transactions.",,,,
"The authenticity of emission data is the basic prerequisite for the normal conduct of carbon emissions trading and the performance of policy functions. Relevant persons in charge of the two departments said that in terms of preventing and punishing falsification of carbon emission data, the regulations mainly provide provisions in four aspects:",,,,
"First, strengthen the main responsibility of key emission units. Key emission units are required to formulate and strictly implement emission data quality control plans, truthfully and accurately calculate greenhouse gas emissions of their units, prepare annual emission reports and be responsible for the authenticity, completeness and accuracy of the reports, disclose information to the public in accordance with regulations and Keep original records and management ledgers.",,,,
"The second is to strengthen the management of technical service agencies. The regulations regulate the behavior of technical service agencies entrusted to carry out greenhouse gas emission-related inspections and testing, as well as technical service agencies entrusted to prepare annual emission reports and conduct technical reviews of annual emission reports.",,,,
The third is to strengthen supervision and inspection. It is stipulated that the ecological environment department and other departments with supervision and management responsibilities can conduct on-site inspections of key emission units and technical service agencies.,,,,
"The fourth is to increase penalties. For those who commit fraud in greenhouse gas emission-related inspections and testing, annual emission report preparation and technical review, strict penalties such as fines, orders to stop production for rectification, cancellation of relevant qualifications, and prohibition from engaging in corresponding businesses are stipulated, and a credit record system is established.",,,,
"The reporter learned that in order to ensure the smooth implementation and implementation of the regulations, relevant parties will continue to do a good job in publicity and implementation, follow up on supporting systems in a timely manner, and improve the regulatory infrastructure.",,,,
"The Regulations clearly stipulate the construction of a national carbon emissions trading market management platform. Relevant parties will take the implementation of the Regulations as an opportunity to coordinate and integrate all forces, accelerate the construction of the management platform, improve the informatization and intelligence level of supervision, and form a joint regulatory force.",,,,

"Vietnam has strong momentum in attracting foreign-invested enterprises. Vietnam is one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing economies in Southeast Asia, attracting large amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI). According to statistics from the Foreign Investment Bureau of the Ministry of Planning and Investment, as of December 2023, Vietnam has attracted more than US$36.6 billion in foreign direct investment, a year-on-year increase of 32.1%. Among them, there were 3,188 newly signed and registered projects, a year-on-year increase of 56.6%; the investment in newly signed projects was nearly US$20.2 billion, a year-on-year increase of 62.2%. According to data from Vietnam’s Ministry of Investment and Planning (MPI), a total of 108 countries and regions will invest in Vietnam in 2022, with investments related to green economy totaling US$9 billion, accounting for 2% of Vietnam’s GDP. In November 2023, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) jointly held the 2023 Vietnam Circular Economy Forum in the capital Hanoi on the formulation of the """"National Action Plan for the Development of Circular Economy"""". The meeting once again emphasized the resolution of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, emphasizing the development of a green economy, reducing waste, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging the development of low-carbon and circular economic models, and seeking effective ways to improve production efficiency. This not only brings trade and investment opportunities to Vietnam, but also higher ESG standards and commitments.",,,,
"The ESG trend in Vietnam is growing day by day. In November 2020, the Vietnamese Congress reviewed and passed the new Environmental Protection Law and it will be implemented in January 2022. The new environmental protection law adds many new contents, such as adding environmental protection indicators to classify investment projects; emphasizing """"polluter pays""""; introducing a carbon emission reporting system, and enterprises must actively participate in data statistics and accept verification by third-party agencies.

Sustainable development and responsible management transformation have become global trends. In the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and other countries have comprehensively mandated the disclosure of ESG reports for listed companies.

Including energy conservation and emission reduction, reducing waste generation and improving energy efficiency. This may involve improvements in manufacturing processes, the use of environmentally friendly materials, and the reduction of environmental pollution. 2) Utilize renewable energy resources. Vietnam has abundant solar and wind energy resources. Businesses can harness solar and wind energy to reduce their reliance on traditional fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 3) Establish a localized supply chain. Cooperate with local suppliers in Vietnam to reduce logistics costs and carbon emissions while promoting local economic growth. 4) Pay attention to social responsibilities and labor rights.

"The State Council executive meeting held on the 18th once again pressed the """"fast forward button"""" for the construction of a unified national market. The meeting emphasized the need to """"establish various systems and rules that are conducive to the construction of a unified national market"""" and """"remove various obstacles and constraints that are not conducive to the construction of a unified national market.""""",,,,
Establish institutional rules,,,,
"Since the beginning of this year, we have taken frequent actions to build a unified national market, from breaking down market barriers in urban and rural areas to comprehensively cleaning up various regulations and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition.",,,,
"At the State Council\'s regular policy briefing held in June, Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that initial results have been achieved in building a unified national market, social consensus has been further strengthened, the implementation path of key tasks has been further clarified, and major reforms in building a unified national market have been accelerated. The deployment has played a positive role in stabilizing development expectations, releasing market vitality, reducing transaction costs, and promoting smooth circulation.",,,,
"The executive meeting of the State Council requested: We must accelerate the improvement of basic systems in market access, property rights protection and transactions, data information, social credit, etc., actively and steadily promote reforms in key areas such as finance, taxation, and statistics, and increase the intensity of pilot exploration. Establish various systems and rules that are conducive to the construction of a unified national market.",,,,
Why should we further accelerate the construction of a unified national market?,,,,
"On the one hand, this is the need to build a new development pattern.",,,,
"Zang Yueru, a researcher at the Market and Price Research Institute of the China Academy of Macroeconomics, said that a strong domestic market is the foundation and prerequisite for building a new development pattern. Accelerating the construction of a unified national market and promoting the smooth flow of commodity factors and resources on a larger scale will promote the domestic market to become an organically connected and mutually coordinated whole and strengthen China\'s ultra-large market advantages.",,,,
"On the other hand, this is also part of the problem of promoting consumption growth and making China more attractive to global investors.",,,,
"Wei Jianguo, former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce of China, said in an interview with China News Service Guoshi Express that the ultra-large market is a prominent advantage of China in international economic competition. However, due to issues such as local protection and market segmentation, China\'s market advantages have not yet been fully utilized. In the context of the overall slowdown in world economic growth and the continued slump in global cross-border direct investment, accelerating the construction of a unified national market will further stimulate consumption potential, boost the vitality and attractiveness of the Chinese market, and stabilize foreign investment.",,,,
"Xu Dandan, vice president of Beijing Technology and Business University, said that building a unified national market requires unified basic systems and rules of the market system. This is the foundation for efficient economic operation and the key to stabilizing entrepreneurs\' expectations and stimulating potential investment demand.",,,,
Analysts believe that starting from establishing institutional rules and improving basic systems is the key to building a unified market.,,,,
Breaking down barriers and constraints,,,,
"This State Council executive meeting made it clear that it is necessary to carry out in-depth special rectification of issues such as market segmentation and local protection, increase the notification of typical cases, and remove various obstacles that are not conducive to the construction of a unified national market.",,,,
"Previously, many places have launched specific measures to break down local protection and regional barriers. For example, the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Market Regulation organized a special law enforcement action in the field of people\'s livelihood, focusing on administrative monopoly behavior, focusing on investigating and punishing the abuse of administrative power to hinder the free circulation of goods, exclude or restrict foreign operators, restrict or disguised transactions, and formulate regulations that exclude and restrict competition. regulations and other behaviors.",,,,
"In Henan, the Henan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau and the Henan Provincial Development and Reform Commission have comprehensively launched a clean-up of policies and measures that hinder the construction of a unified national market, and self-examined and cleaned up the currently effective policies and measures involving the economic activities of business entities that were formulated before July 1, 2022.",,,,
"Xu Dandan said that market segmentation and various institutional factors that hinder the flow of factors still exist to varying degrees, which to a certain extent increases the costs of enterprises and limits the innovation vitality of business entities. At the same time, problems such as imperfect laws and regulations, lax law enforcement, and uncoordinated supervision in market supervision will also damage consumer rights and a fair competitive environment for enterprises.",,,,
"Xu Dandan said that the current market supervision rules, standards and procedures are still lack of uniformity among different regions and industries, and it is difficult for some production factors to play an active role in the production process and participate in distribution. In some areas, there are still problems such as relatively lagging infrastructure construction and unbalanced and inadequate public services.",,,,
"Analysts believe that the various special rectifications deployed at this executive meeting target various obstacles and blockages such as local protection and market segmentation, and will help speed up the process of building a unified market. (Li Xiaoyu)",,,,

"In the first half of the year, GDP increased by 5% year-on-year, and the overall upward trend continued. Among them, the economy had a better-than-expected start in the first quarter, with a year-on-year growth of 5.3%; in the second quarter, the growth rate slowed down, with a year-on-year growth of 4.7%. Judging from the above data, the current pace of economic operation continues the basic characteristics of the past few years of """"a good start in the first quarter, and increasing downward pressure in the second quarter."""" In the future, it is likely to further continue that """"the measures to stabilize growth will be introduced in the third quarter and the economy will rebound, and continue in the fourth quarter."""" It’s picking up but slightly down.” The reason for such rhythmic characteristics is mainly due to the fact that in the first quarter, local governments and local governments started work and launched efforts ahead of schedule, but the problems of insufficient aggregate demand and sluggish expectations still existed. The foundation for economic recovery was not solid, and it subsequently fell back.",,,,
"In terms of economic momentum, the first half of the year was mainly due to higher-than-expected exports, higher growth in manufacturing investment, and higher growth in infrastructure investment driven by central fiscal expenditures. However, real estate has not yet stabilized, and local infrastructure is limited due to tight local fiscal balances. From the perspective of micro entities, the enthusiasm of local governments, residents, entrepreneurs and other micro entities needs to be further improved. In the first half of the year, the nominal GDP growth rate was 4.1% year-on-year, which was lower than the actual growth rate of 5%. The downturn in prices directly affected residents\' income, corporate income and fiscal revenue.",,,,
"For the second half of the year, we must fully affirm the effects of some previous policies and continue them, and we must further adopt more powerful policies.",,,,
"In terms of fiscal policy, this year is limited by land transfer revenue and general public budget revenue falling short of expectations, and thus fiscal expenditures falling short of expectations. We can consider adding additional deficits and issuance of treasury bonds. The additional treasury bonds can be used for three purposes: First, those with greater pressure to re-lend Some local governments are mitigating liquidity risks and promoting local governments to return to normalcy from the emergency state. The second is to provide partial subsidies to unemployed and unemployed college graduates who have graduated in recent years, as well as urban and rural low-income people, to improve their risk resistance and consumption capabilities, maintain social stability, and do not have to worry about the phenomenon of supporting lazy people, because this part has not yet The employment of college students is closely related to the impact of the epidemic in recent years. It is an objective rather than a subjective cause. The issuance of subsidies is an emergency measure, not a regular measure. It has an exit cycle and is intended to win a more stable economic and social development environment for the reform; the method can be in the form of a pilot. The third is to invest in major projects planned for the 15th Five-Year Plan in advance, and at the same time give sufficient project reserve time to avoid project packaging and low fund use efficiency caused by temporary project search.",,,,
"In terms of monetary policy, although it is constrained by the narrowing of internal and external interest rate spreads and the exchange rate, lowering the required reserve ratio and interest rates are still policy options.",,,,
"In terms of real estate policy, continue to optimize real estate policies and reverse the expected downward trend in real estate prices as soon as possible, relax purchase restrictions, increase home purchase indicators in first-tier cities, and optimize stock to release incremental demand; increase government procurement and storage and let the central government solve some local funding problems; increase Supply of high-quality commercial housing in core areas.",,,,
"1. The results in the first half of the year were hard-won, and some policy effects have been reflected. However, greater policy efforts must be taken to expand aggregate demand and boost confidence.",,,,
"First, the price level rebounded modestly, with CPI and PPI rising from -0.8% and -2.5% in January to 0.2% and -0.8% in June respectively year-on-year.",,,,
"Second, exports continue to pick up. The global manufacturing PMI has been in the expansion range for six consecutive months. China\'s exports continued to rise from 1.4% in the first quarter to 8.6% in June.",,,,
"Third, the capacity utilization rate increased. In the second quarter, the industrial capacity utilization rate was 74.9%, which was higher than the 73.6% and 74.5% in the first quarter and the same period last year.",,,,
"Fourth, industrial transformation and upgrading accelerated. In the first half of the year, the added value of high-tech manufacturing accounted for 15.8% of the added value of industries above designated size, an increase of 0.6 percentage points from the first quarter.",,,,
"Fifth, the effects of policies to stabilize growth have gradually emerged. Investment in equipment renewal, trade-in of consumer goods, and investment in central infrastructure have all been boosted to varying degrees.",,,,
2. How to understand the slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter?,,,,
"The current external environment is complex, domestic effective demand is still insufficient, and the foundation for economic recovery still needs to be consolidated, which is reflected in the decline in growth in the second quarter. GDP growth in the second quarter was 4.7% year-on-year, 0.6 percentage points lower than the first quarter, and lower than market expectations of 5.1%.",,,,
"On the one hand, economic growth in the second quarter was affected by temporary factors such as extreme weather and data """"squeezing water"""". The first is disturbances from extreme weather such as floods in the south and drought in the north. Since April, floods and geological disasters have occurred frequently in the south, while localized high temperatures and droughts have occurred in the north, affecting normal local production and living order. Second, financial data is """"squeezing out water"""" and the added value of the financial industry is """"getting rid of obesity"""". However, since April, the financial regulatory authorities have prohibited banks from """"manually supplementing interest rates"""", and the statistics department has optimized and adjusted the financial industry\'s value-added accounting method. The behavior of idling funds and the pressure to increase deposits and loans have been significantly reduced. The growth rate of loans has continued to decline, which has depressed the financial industry. Industry value added growth rate.",,,,
"On the other hand, insufficient domestic effective demand is the main reason for the slowdown in economic growth. First, residents’ consumption and home purchases have shown a trend of frugality and risk aversion. In the first half of the year, social retail consumption increased by 3.7% year-on-year, lower than the 4.7% in the first quarter. The real estate sales area in June was still at a low of -14.5% year-on-year; second, Corporate investment confidence still needs to be boosted, with cumulative manufacturing investment continuing to fall from 9.9% in January to March to 9.5% in January to June; third, the tight balance of local finances restricts local infrastructure investment. In the first half of the year, the public facilities management industry and The cumulative year-on-year investment in the road transportation industry was -4.5% and -1% respectively.",,,,
"3. The pressure to stabilize growth may increase further in the second half of the year. It is necessary to consider additional fiscal deficits to further increase the growth rate of fiscal expenditures, cut reserve requirements and interest rates, and increase incremental real estate demand in first-tier cities.",,,,
"To achieve the annual economic growth target of “around 5%”, GDP in the second half of the year must still remain at around 5% year-on-year. Taking into account the slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter, and the base number for the same period in the second half of the year is higher than that in the second quarter, the responsibility for stabilizing growth in the second half of the year may be further increased.",,,,
"It is expected that the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee will further expand reform and opening up, stimulate the enthusiasm and vitality of micro entities such as residents, enterprises, and local governments, promote the development of new productive forces, and increase the potential economic growth rate; the Politburo meeting at the end of July may introduce measures A larger, faster-paced, and more targeted package of stabilizing growth policies will expand aggregate demand and accelerate the pace of economic recovery.",,,,
"Risk warning: External shocks exceed expectations, and policies to stabilize growth exceed expectations.",,,,
"Open market operations: January 5 1 The Central Bank of China: Today it conducted a 7-day reverse repurchase operation of 75 billion yuan, with the winning rate at 1.80%, the same as before. As 486 billion yuan of reverse repurchase expired today, a net withdrawal of 411 billion yuan was achieved on that day.",,,,
"MLF operation: There is no MLF placement or operation by the central bank today, and the winning interest rate is 2.50%, which is consistent with the previous PSL operation: There is no PSL placement or operation by the central bank today.",,,,
TMLF: There are no TMLF expirations and operations today. Due to treasury fixed deposit operations: There are no treasury fixed deposit expirations and operations today.,,,,
"Implementation Opinions of the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration on Establishing a Coal Production Capacity Reserve System, Development and Reform Commissions, Energy Bureaus, and Coal Industry Management Departments of all coal-producing provinces (regions) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Energy Regulations [2024] No. 413, relevant Central enterprises: In order to thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, conscientiously implement the new energy security strategy, implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on promoting primary product supply security and price stability, and deepen the coal supply-side structure To carry out structural reforms, innovate production capacity management mechanisms, improve production capacity reserve policies, promote coal production capacity to maintain a reasonable margin and sufficient flexibility, enhance supply security capabilities, and better play the role of coal in energy supply, we have formulated the following implementation opinions. 1. General requirements: Give full play to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation, better play the role of the government, proactively adapt to changes in coal supply and demand, form stable production capacity reserve support policy expectations, and actively guide qualified enterprises to build coal reserve capacity. Focusing on large-scale modern open-pit coal mines and underground coal mines with high safety guarantees, we will select a number of coal mines with capacity reserves among new and under-construction coal mine projects, and actively and steadily organize implementation.. Maintain reasonable and sufficient coal production capacity, enhance the elasticity and flexibility of coal supply, and effectively respond to cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in coal supply.. Vigorously improve the quality of green production, promote the coordination of production capacity reserves and ecological environment protection, increase investment in safety and security, and ensure safety and reliability during the daily maintenance and release of reserved production capacity.. By 2027, a coal production capacity reserve system will be initially established, the construction of a number of coal mine projects with capacity reserves will be approved in an orderly manner, and a certain scale of dispatchable production capacity reserves will be formed.. By 2030, the production capacity reserve system will be more complete, the production capacity management system will be more complete, and we will strive to form a dispatchable production capacity reserve of about 300 million tons/year. The national coal supply guarantee capacity will be significantly enhanced, and supply elasticity and resilience will continue to improve.. 2. Working rules for the construction of capacity reserve coal mines. The design capacity of capacity reserve coal mines consists of two parts: conventional production capacity and reserve capacity.. Conventional production capacity refers to the normal production capacity of coal mines under non-emergency conditions. Production is organized independently by enterprises according to market conditions and is not included in the scope of national unified dispatch.. Reserve production capacity refers to a moderate-scale production capacity reserved on the basis of conventional production capacity for peak shaving. In emergency situations, it is released simultaneously with conventional production capacity according to national unified dispatch to achieve """"upward elastic production"""" of coal mines.. Capacity Reserve The sum of the conventional production capacity and reserve capacity of a coal mine is the design capacity.. During the construction process of capacity reserve coal mines, implementation should be organized according to the following requirements: (1) Planning stage. In the preparation (revision) of the coal mining area overall plan, the coal mining area overall planning preparation department at the provincial level and below must organize a careful study of the planned new and under-construction coal mine projects in the mining area to demonstrate whether the project has the conditions to build reserve production capacity. Scientifically and rationally determine the planning and construction scale of a single coal mine. In principle, coal mines with production capacity reserves should be completed and put into operation at one time according to the designed production capacity.. The project unit must conduct in-depth research on the feasibility of building capacity reserve coal mines to ensure that it is economically reasonable, safe and controllable. The mining area’s external transportation infrastructure must fully consider the release of reserve capacity.. (2) Approval stage. New coal mine projects that plan to build reserve production capacity must submit land pre-examination and site selection opinions, social stability risk assessment reports, etc. based on the designed production capacity.. When preparing a project application report, an in-depth analysis of the reserve capacity construction and production plan should be conducted. Coal mine projects under construction can build reserve production capacity based on the existing approved production capacity, or they can apply to adjust the construction scale and build reserve production capacity in accordance with relevant policy requirements.. (3) Construction stage. Capacity reserve coal mines should comply with the overall planning of the mining area and the planning environmental impact assessment requirements, and handle various procedures for mining, land use, forest use, grass use, environmental impact assessment, water intake permits, soil and water conservation, safety production and other procedures in accordance with the design production capacity and in accordance with laws and regulations. Create conditions for the release of reserve production capacity in accordance with laws and regulations. Coal mine production, transportation, ventilation, drainage, electromechanical and other systems and related equipment must be constructed and equipped according to the designed capacity to ensure that reserve capacity can be safely and effectively released in emergency situations. Capacity reserve coal mines mainly form reserve capacity by enhancing mining (stripping) capabilities and increasing working face advancement, and do not achieve this by increasing working faces.. It is necessary to strengthen construction safety management and strictly implement the """"three simultaneous"""" system for safety facilities. (4) Acceptance stage. After the project enters joint trial operation, trial production will be organized according to the designed production capacity and conventional production capacity. Within the specified joint trial operation period, the project unit can independently determine the time to organize trial production according to the two production capacities according to the actual situation of the coal mine.. When organizing the completion acceptance, the project unit must clarify the production capacity reserve construction status in the completion acceptance report.. Provincial coal industry management departments should strengthen the supervision of project completion acceptance activities. If the reserve capacity construction does not meet the requirements, the project unit will be ordered to make rectifications. Only when the requirements are met can the project be completed and put into production.. (5) Production stage. Capacity Reserve Coal mines must improve the """"peace and emergency conversion"""" mechanism, study and formulate work plans to organize production according to conventional production capacity and designed capacity, rationally arrange production organizations, maintain safe and stable production order, and give full play to the role of production capacity reserves. It is necessary to rationally allocate personnel and scientifically arrange the extraction (stripping) connection on a daily basis, and make preparations for emergency production in advance.. Under emergency conditions, we must resolutely obey the unified dispatch of the country and quickly release reserve production capacity to ensure that output can be produced, deployed quickly, and used.. It is necessary to effectively increase investment in production safety, strengthen the investigation and management of hidden dangers, and continuously enhance the ability to ensure safe supply.. 3. Management procedures for capacity reserve coal mines (1) Application conditions. Coal mines that apply for building reserve capacity should be newly built or under construction coal mine projects approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration. The scale of coal mine reserve capacity is divided into three levels: 20%, 25% and 30% according to the proportion of the coal mine's designed production capacity.. The mining area where the reserve capacity coal mine is located should have convenient external transportation and sufficient transportation capacity. Coal products are mainly used to ensure power generation, heating and people's energy needs.. (2) Application process. The relevant coal industry management departments of coal-producing provinces and regions, together with the development and reform departments at the same level (or the coal investment departments designated by provincial governments), shall organize the declaration of production capacity reserve coal mines in the provinces and regions in accordance with these implementation opinions and relevant notice requirements.. Coal enterprises (including central enterprises) shall prepare production capacity reserve construction plans and submit applications based on actual conditions such as resource conditions, mining technology, external transportation conditions, etc. The relevant coal industry management departments of coal-producing provinces and districts shall work together with the development and reform departments at the same level (or designated by provincial governments). The coal investment authority) will conduct a preliminary review and report coal mine projects that meet the application conditions to the National Energy Administration.. (3) Confirmation procedure. The National Energy Administration entrusted relevant evaluation agencies to organize experts to evaluate the coal mine projects that applied for the construction of reserve capacity, and based on the evaluation results, they coordinated and determined the list of coal mine projects and the scale of production capacity reserve construction, and gave priority to supporting the five largest coal mines in Shanxi, western Inner Mongolia, eastern Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. Large-scale modern open-pit coal mines in supply guarantee bases or underground coal mines with high safety guarantees. (4) Activation mechanism. When the coal supply and demand situation is generally balanced, production capacity reserve coal mines will be organized according to regular production capacity after they are put into operation.. When the supply and demand situation shifts from overall balance to tension, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration implement unified dispatching of reserve production capacity based on coal market supply and demand and whether the price exceeds a reasonable range, and determine the emergency release area of ​​reserve production capacity, production dispatch scale, Supply guarantee targets, etc., guide reserve capacity coal mines to """"upward elastic production"""" according to the design capacity in stages while ensuring safety.. (5) Signing of medium and long-term contracts. Capacity reserve coal mines must strictly fulfill their responsibilities of ensuring coal supply and stable price, sign medium- and long-term thermal coal contracts in accordance with relevant requirements, and implement relevant national price policies. Commercial coal produced by coal mines with reserve capacity that releases reserve capacity will be given priority to be dispatched by the state and will no longer be responsible for signing local medium- and long-term contracts.. 4. Supporting Support Policies (1) Provide preferential policies for production capacity replacement. For capacity reserve coal mines, if a newly built coal mine has a reserve capacity of 20%, 25%, or 30% of the designed capacity, 60%, 80%, or 100% of its new capacity (including conventional production capacity and reserve capacity) will be exempted from capacity replacement.. For capacity replacement plans that have been reviewed and confirmed (including coal mines under construction), 60%, 80%, and 100% of the total capacity replacement indicators can be used separately, and the indicators will no longer be converted.. (2) Optimize and adjust the overall planning of coal mining areas and planning environmental impact assessment requirements. Capacity reserve coal mines must strictly follow the approved coal mining area master plan and planning environmental impact assessment to handle relevant approval procedures. When resource reserves and mining conditions change significantly, on the premise that the service life requirements are met, the design production capacity can fluctuate by 1 to 3 design levels based on the overall planning of the coal mining area. In principle, the maximum increase should be lower than the planned construction scale. 30%, and there are no major planning adjustments stipulated in the """"Notice on Further Strengthening the Management of Environmental Impact Assessment of Coal Resource Development"""" (EIA [2020] No. 63). The above-mentioned optimization adjustments are non-major adjustments to the overall planning of the coal mining area. A partial adjustment plan may be prepared and submitted to the original planning approval authority for approval.. (3) Implement separate listing of new coal production capacity indicators. For coal mines with capacity reserves, the reserve capacity scale does not occupy the new production capacity indicators of the provinces and regions determined by the national coal development plan.. 5. Safeguard measures (1) Strengthening organization and coordination. Establish a working mechanism for coal production capacity reserve management, strengthen overall planning and guidance, and coordinate the management of national coal production capacity reserves. Relevant coal industry management departments in coal-producing provinces and regions, in conjunction with development and reform departments at the same level, can establish provincial working mechanisms based on actual conditions to guide enterprises within their jurisdiction to prepare production capacity reserves.. (2) Consolidation of work responsibilities. Project units of capacity reserve coal mines must strictly fulfill their main responsibilities, solidly promote the construction of capacity reserve coal mines, ensure that construction tasks are completed on schedule with quality and quantity, organize production according to unified national dispatch, and effectively play the role of capacity reserve coal mines. Provincial coal industry management departments must fulfill their supervisory and management responsibilities, strengthen daily supervision of capacity reserve coal mines within their jurisdiction, establish work accounts for each mine, and schedule and grasp the production conditions of capacity reserve coal mines under both non-emergency and emergency conditions. Related platforms Account information is regularly submitted to the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration. (3) Strengthen supervision and management. The National Energy Administration, together with relevant departments, has strengthened the comprehensive coordination, supervision and guidance of the national coal production capacity reserve work, studied and solved major problems in the construction and production process of production capacity reserve coal mines, and promoted the orderly development of all work on production capacity reserve.. Provincial coal industry management departments shall organize and carry out inspections in a timely manner. Those who fail to organize construction and production in accordance with relevant national regulations shall be ordered to make rectifications within a time limit. Those who violate relevant laws and regulations shall be punished in accordance with regulations to ensure the implementation of various requirements for production capacity reserves.. This implementation opinion is interpreted by the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration. It will come into effect from the date of issuance and will be valid for 5 years..

"Event: On May 31, the National Bureau of Statistics released official PMI data for May. In May, the manufacturing PMI was 49.5%, the previous value was 50.4%; the non-manufacturing PMI was 51.1%, the previous value was 51.2%.",,,,
"Core point of view: The manufacturing PMI fell more than expected in May, which not only had an impact on the month-on-month data due to the high previous base, but also reflected a lack of momentum for economic recovery. Both manufacturing supply and demand fell, but the production side was still better than demand, and the demand index fell back to the contraction range. The price of raw materials continues to rise, and the price difference between raw materials and ex-factory products has widened, which is not conducive to the improvement of corporate profits. Small and medium-sized enterprises are relatively affected by insufficient demand, while large enterprises are making steady progress. Structurally, the growth rate of new driving forces has slowed down but is still in the expansion range, and the supply and demand of the equipment manufacturing industry is relatively resilient. In terms of non-manufacturing, the May Day holiday led to a better release of demand in the service industry; the construction industry index fell back from its high level, and real estate is still operating at a low temperature. Looking forward, the current lack of demand will still be an important constraint. In May, the new round of property market policies intensified, which will have a positive effect on improving new home sales, digesting existing real estate, and stabilizing real estate investment. The issuance of ultra-long-term special government bonds has begun, and special bonds have Issuance may accelerate, consumer product replacement policies will support the release of bulk consumer demand, and the demand side may improve.",,,,
"Manufacturing PMI was lower than expected. The manufacturing PMI in May fell by 0.9 percentage points from the previous month to 49.5%, which was expected to be 50.1%, and the level of economic prosperity dropped. Compared with the same period in previous years, the manufacturing PMI in May this year was 50.4% lower than the average for the same period in the past 10 years. Looking at the sub-indexes, except for the two price indexes and the employee index, all other indexes fell back to varying degrees.",,,,
"Supply and demand both dropped month-on-month, with production outperforming demand. In May, the production and new order indexes were 50.8% and 49.6% respectively. The production index fell by 2.1 percentage points month-on-month, the new orders index fell by 1.5 percentage points month-on-month, and the new export orders index fell by 2.3 percentage points month-on-month. On the demand side, the new orders index increased sharply by 4 percentage points month-on-month in March, and market demand was relatively concentrated and strong. The demand growth rate slowed down in April, and domestic demand further weakened in May. The proportion of companies reporting insufficient demand in May was 60.6%, an increase of 1.2 percentage points from the previous month. From the production side, the growth rate of manufacturing production has slowed down but is still in the expansion range. The larger month-on-month decline may be affected by the higher base in the previous period. The production index (52.9%) in April was the highest in the past year.",,,,
"Both price indexes increased month-on-month. In May, the raw material purchase price index rose by 2.9 percentage points from the previous month to 56.9%, and corporate production costs increased. Although rising raw material prices have provided some support to finished product prices, with the ex-factory price index rising 1.3 percentage points month-on-month to 50.4% in May, the price gap between the two continues to widen, which is not conducive to further improvements in corporate efficiency.",,,,
"Large enterprises accelerated their expansion, while the prosperity of small and medium-sized enterprises declined. In May, the PMIs of large, medium and small enterprises were 50.7%, 49.4% and 46.7% respectively. Among them, the PMI of large enterprises increased by 0.4 percentage points month-on-month, and the PMI of medium-sized and small enterprises dropped by 1.3 and 3.6 percentage points respectively from the previous month to 49.4% and 46.7%. The prosperity of small enterprises declined significantly. In terms of demand, demand from large enterprises performed well, with the new order index rising by 1 percentage point month-on-month; the new order index for small and medium-sized enterprises all fell.",,,,

He Zhonglin, deputy director of the Intellectual Property Court of the Supreme People\'s Court, said that the court accepts more and more cutting-edge technologies. New types of disputes continue to emerge, posing new challenges to judicial protection. It is necessary to adhere to the trial concepts of strict protection, proactive justice, and overall coordination, improve the trial system, improve the trial mechanism, and speed up the formulation of special procedural laws for intellectual property litigation.",,,,
"The problems of """"difficulty in providing evidence and long cycle"""" in intellectual property rights protection have attracted widespread attention from all walks of life. Zhou Xiang, deputy director of the Intellectual Property Court of the Supreme People\'s Court, said that the court makes full use of legal systems such as the transfer of the burden of proof and obstruction of proof to effectively reduce the difficulty of proof for right holders. At the same time, it supports the parties\' evidence preservation and investigation and evidence collection applications in accordance with the law, and promotes the resolution of """" """"Difficult to prove"""" problem.",,,,

"Ride six dragons at a time"""", when they are latent, they are latent, and when they appear, they appear... Dragons have no permanent shape, and they change when they ride, and they are not always determined, but they are suitable for the right time. 2024 is the year of the largest election in history. In addition, geopolitics has intensified geo-economic fragmentation, and the market is looking forward to interest rate cuts. The investment prospects are unpredictable. CASH Wealth Management Research Department has provided an in-depth analysis of the 2024 dragon for investors. Annual investment recommendations, and asset allocation recommendations for different regions, different asset classes, and different maturities, in order to """"get rich next to others"""" and achieve customers\' wealth management goals.",,,,
"In 2024, CASH Wealth Management’s big data module research discovered six high-quality investment themes. In terms of the stock market, we are optimistic about the world, especially as Mexico\'s economy transforms, Japan\'s stock market continues to boom, the Indian market enters another stage of development, and mainland China stocks are discounted, some unique investment opportunities will emerge in these markets. In addition to stocks, Bitcoin and its related ETFs will continue to rise; and the interest rate theme will continue to affect the market this year, making some of these fixed income securities very attractive.",,,,
"The real GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew at an annualized quarter-on-quarter rate of 3.3%, significantly higher than the expected 2.0%, and the previous value was 4.9%. Looking at the whole year, the U.S. economy will grow by 2.5% in 2023, higher than the 1.9% growth rate in 2022. We believe the U.S. economy will remain resilient through at least the first half of 2024:",,,,
"Real purchasing power has increased, and consumer spending may continue to support the resilience of the U.S. economy. Although the summer consumption boom subsided in the third quarter, as inflation gradually eased in the fourth quarter, residents\' real purchasing power is rising, resulting in consumer spending remaining strong. Therefore, although the growth rate of consumer spending was lower than the 3.1% in the third quarter, the growth rate in the fourth quarter still reached 2.8%, contributing more than half to GDP growth, reaching 1.9 percentage points. Although the current labor market has slowed down, it is still far from weakening. It is expected that wage growth will not fall back quickly, and residents’ excess savings will still be able to support it until the second half of 2024. We expect consumer spending to still support U.S. economic growth. toughness.",,,,
"Private investment has cooled, but residential investment is expected to rise again in 2024, driven by expectations of interest rate cuts. In the third quarter, driven by the rapid growth of residential investment, the private investment growth rate reached 10%, but fell to 2.1% in the fourth quarter, while the residential growth rate also dropped from 6.7% in the previous quarter to 1.1%, which may be mainly due to 4 This was caused by the rapid rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and mortgage rates at the beginning of the quarter, which slowed down residential investment activity. At present, long-term U.S. bond interest rates have fallen from high levels, and under the influence of rising expectations for interest rate cuts, it is expected that the growth rate of residential investment may rise again.",,,,
"Inventory contribution has cooled significantly, but U.S. manufacturers\' inventories are currently at low levels and will soon turn to active replenishment. The contribution of U.S. inventory growth to GDP in the fourth quarter dropped to 0.07% from 1.27% in the third quarter. Inventories of U.S. manufacturers are already at low levels, and they are about to shift from passive destocking to active replenishment. We expect that in 2024, inventory growth will become one of the important supports for U.S. economic growth.",,,,
"The Red Sea shipping crisis may support U.S. exports. The U.S. export growth rate rose sharply in the fourth quarter, from 5.4% in the third quarter to 6.3% in the fourth quarter, which may be mainly driven by energy exports to Europe. We have mentioned in """"Red Sea Shipping Crisis May Test Interest Rate Cut Expectations"""" that the current Red Sea shipping situation is still unclear, and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East is still escalating. It is expected that the European region may increase its import of U.S. energy, thereby supporting U.S. exports. .",,,,
"Although U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter was significantly higher than expected, market bets on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates increased instead of falling. The interest rate futures market shows that after the release of the fourth quarter GDP data, market expectations for a March interest rate cut rose to 46.2%, compared with 42.5% before the data was released. The main reason is that the US core PCE in the fourth quarter was in line with expectations, while the fourth quarter GDP price index was 1.5 %, lower than the expected 2.3% and the previous value of 3.3%.",,,,
"Outlook: The U.S. GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2023 once again demonstrated its economic resilience. We believe that the U.S. economy will remain resilient in the first half of 2024: 1) Residents’ excess savings and rising real purchasing power will still support consumer spending; 2) Although the labor market has slowed down, it is still far from weakening, and wage growth is relatively strong. ; 3) Manufacturers\' inventories have bottomed out, or they may turn to active replenishment; 4) The Red Sea shipping crisis supports its energy exports. Combined with the fact that U.S. inflation is still sticky and has upward risks, we believe that the current conditions for the Fed to cut interest rates are still insufficient, so the market\'s interest rate cut expectations appear to be too optimistic. Although the current market interest rate cut expectations have been revised, bets on 5-6 rate cuts throughout the year are still optimistic, and there may still be room for revision.",,,,
"With the end of corporate inventory reduction and the moderate increase in residents' consumption propensity, the economy rebounded slightly in the third quarter. Driven by the rebound of the manufacturing industry in developed economies, it is expected that China's economy will continue to strengthen at the export and manufacturing levels in the future.",,,,
"Considering that there is little pressure to achieve the full-year economic target, the policy may maintain its current intensity, and the recovery of future economic activities will mainly rely on the market entities themselves.",,,,
"The hidden worry in the current economy lies in the real estate industry. With the relaxation of demand policies, commercial housing sales may improve moderately. However, the liquidity pressure faced by real estate companies still exists, which means that it may take time for the investment activities of real estate companies to stabilize, and the economy is still in the process of bottoming out.",,,,
Risk warning: (1) Geopolitical risks (2) Policy stimulus exceeds expectations,,,,
"In 2024, as expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve continue to be postponed, U.S. bond interest rates and the U.S. dollar exchange rate continue to hit new highs for the year, and the exchange rates and risk asset prices of some developed and emerging market countries are under pressure.

Hot thoughts: An approaching “emerging market crisis”?,,,,
"1. War without gunpowder: Is a new round of """"currency crisis"""" and """"debt crisis"""" in emerging market countries on the way?",,,,
"Since April, emerging market stock markets have plummeted, exchange rates have been under pressure, and the probability of sovereign debt defaults has also increased, which seems to be a precursor to a """"currency crisis."""" 1) In terms of stock markets, since April 8, the MSCI Latin America, Asia, and Europe, Africa and Middle East emerging market indexes have fallen by 6.3%, 4.1%, and 3.4% respectively. 2) In terms of exchange rates, since April 8, the Colombian peso, Indonesian rupiah, and real have depreciated by 3.9%, 2.5%, and 2.1% against the US dollar. 3) The risk of sovereign debt defaults in some countries has increased significantly. The renewed strength of the U.S. dollar under the """"reflation"""" trade may be the main reason for the recent pressure on emerging markets. The risk of reflation and the resilience of the economy are the main reasons for the strength of the US dollar: 1) The US de-inflation process has reached a """"death cross"""", and the downward slope of core CPI has slowed down significantly in the past six months. 2) Since the beginning of the year, against the background of long-term global destocking and continued loosening of financial conditions, the global manufacturing industry has revived. In addition, geopolitical and other factors may intensify the """"risks"""" in emerging markets in the near future.",,,,
"2. Currency crises in history: The Fed’s interest rate hike is the trigger, while EM’s fundamentals and financial conditions are the determining factors.",,,,
"The market\'s concerns are not groundless. Several emerging market currency crises in history did occur against the background of """"the Federal Reserve raising interest rates."""" For example, the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, the Mexican peso crisis in 1994, and the Asian currency crisis in 1997 all occurred during the Fed\'s interest rate hike cycle; even the Fed\'s Taper in 2014 was enough to trigger a rebound in the currencies of some emerging market countries. Significant depreciation.",,,,
"However, the Fed\'s interest rate hike is only the trigger, and the fundamentals and financial conditions of emerging markets are the determining factors. Looking back at history, the common problems in emerging markets in the past four rounds of currency crises mainly include: 1) The economic fundamentals are relatively weak, and the current account is susceptible to fluctuations in resource prices; 2) The exchange rate/monetary policy is relatively rigid, making it difficult to face crises. adjustment; 3) a large inflow of """"hot money"""" before the crisis, resulting in a high proportion of foreign debt; 4) the scale of foreign exchange reserves is low and the ability to resist risks is weak.",,,,
"3. This time may be different: high interest rates and a strong US dollar are short-term stress tests, but currency-debt crises are still tail risks",,,,
"This round of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve may put short-term pressure on emerging markets, but the impact of hot money flows may be relatively limited. There are three categories of driving factors for hot money flows in emerging markets: 1) “Push”, which is the factor that prompts AEs investors to invest in EMDEs, which is related to the supply of funds; 2) “Pull”, which is the cyclical and structural attractiveness of EMs themselves; 3) “Channels”, financial market infrastructure, etc. In this round, the """"push"""" does exist, but the demand-side fundamentals are sound, the finances are sound, and the financial infrastructure is complete. From the perspective of fundamentals, monetary policy, capital liquidity, etc., most """"emerging markets"""" may not need to be worried. 1) The manufacturing boom in emerging markets is better than that of developed economies, and the margins are still improving; 2) Some emerging markets have room to raise interest rates and exchange rates are flexible; 3) Compared with past crises, emerging markets have not had a large amount of """"hot money"""" in recent years. influx; 4) the short-term debt/foreign reserve ratio in most emerging markets is low; 5) commodity prices are still rising, which is conducive to the improvement of the international balance of payments of """"resource countries"""".",,,,

Topic content summary,,,,
"The PMI composite index in January rebounded by 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and the recovery rate was better than the comparable historical average of 0.4 percentage points. From a structural point of view, most sub-indices have super-seasonal performance. High-frequency data related to entities in January were generally good, population mobility rebounded month-on-month, performance of most industrial sectors improved, the real estate market continued to improve marginally, and high-frequency indicators related to infrastructure also remained stable. Combining the performance of PMI and high-frequency data in January, we believe that there is a high probability that industrial production in January is also expected to rebound month-on-month. Looking forward, we maintain our judgment that China's economy may return to the track of recovery in the first half of 2024.",,,,
PMI rebounded super-seasonally in January,,,,
"The PMI index in January was 49.2%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Compared with comparable years between 2013 and 2019 when the Spring Festival fell in February, the PMI index in January dropped 0.2 percentage points from the previous month on average; the rebound in the PMI index in January this year was significantly better than seasonal. From a structural point of view, most sub-indices have super-seasonal performance. Among them, the sub-indices of demand and production both rebounded significantly beyond the season, rising by 0.3 and 1.1 percentage points respectively from the previous month. Enterprises showed certain characteristics of replenishing inventories. Although the price of raw materials was affected by the price of crude oil, it was still under pressure. However, the price of finished products was still under pressure. Price performance is still better than seasonal.",,,,
Entity-related high-frequency data is generally improving,,,,
"There are many highlights of entity-related high-frequency indicators in January: the performance of most industrial industries has improved, including the production of steel, all-steel tires, semi-steel tires, and the operating rates of the textile and PTA industries have all rebounded. Compared with the same period in 2019, The compound average growth rate increased by 3.6, 1.0, 3.0, 1.7, and 2.3 percentage points respectively from the previous month; the real estate market also continued to show some signs of marginal improvement. The compound average growth rate of new home sales area in 30 cities compared with the same period in 2019 was higher than that of the previous month. It rose by 0.7 percentage points; population mobility rebounded from the previous month, which is good for offline consumption. In addition, high-frequency indicators related to infrastructure construction also remained stable.",,,,
How to look forward to January’s economic data?,,,,
"The PMI index rebounded super-seasonally in January, and the recovery rate was 0.4 percentage points better than the comparable historical average. Historical experience shows that the month-on-month changes in the manufacturing PMI index have a high correlation with the month-on-month changes in industrial added value (the goodness of fit is 0.73). Combined with the recent improvement in high-frequency data on the real economy, we believe that there is a high probability that industrial production and even the overall economy will rebound month-on-month in January.",,,,
"Looking ahead, we maintain our forecast that the economy will recover in the first or second quarter",,,,
"In the medium term, we believe that in the first or second quarter of 2024, the quarter-on-quarter GDP growth rate may return to above 1.1%-1.2%, promoting the convergence of the negative output gap and economic recovery. On the one hand, judging from the data in the past two months, corporate capital expenditure expansion, industrial corporate profit growth, income and consumption rebound may be forming a positive cycle to a certain extent. On the other hand, recent policies to stabilize growth have been continuously introduced to safeguard economic stability. The central bank's announcement of reserve requirement ratio and structural interest rate cuts on January 24 sent a strong signal to stabilize growth. Policies to stabilize growth in real estate and other fields are also continuing to be introduced and intensified.",,,,
"Risk warning: The economy and policies are inconsistent with expectations, geopolitical relations have deteriorated more than expected, external demand has declined more than expected, and systemic risks have emerged in real estate.",,,,
"Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 9th: Question: The Implementation Regulations of the Consumer Rights Protection Law will be implemented in July. What are the highlights?",,,,
Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Wenjun,,,,
"The Implementing Regulations of the Consumer Rights Protection Law will be implemented in July this year. At the State Council\'s regular policy briefing held by the State Council Information Office on the 9th, relevant responsible persons from the State Administration for Market Regulation, the Supreme People\'s Court, the Ministry of Justice, the Cyberspace Administration of China and other departments introduced the regulations. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the implementation of the Consumer Rights Protection Law. As a supporting administrative regulation, what are the highlights and what impact will the regulations bring?",,,,
Adhere to problem orientation,,,,
"Liu Jun, deputy director of the State Administration for Market Regulation, introduced that the regulations adhere to a problem-oriented and systematic concept, and clearly require the formation of a common governance system that combines operators\' law-abiding, industry self-discipline, consumer participation, government supervision, and social supervision, with a focus on refining the operators\' obligations. A series of regulations have been made on strengthening national protection and improving dispute resolution.",,,,
"Liu Jun said that in order to protect consumers\' personal and property safety, it is stipulated that in addition to general goods and services, gifts must also be safe and """"free without liability."""" Focusing on the true disclosure of information, the common situations of false propaganda are enumerated, and it is also stipulated that no fictitious or exaggerated treatment, health care, health and other effects are allowed to induce the elderly to consume, and that consumers can protect their pension funds. Focusing on protecting consumers\' right to safety, it is stipulated that """"promotional information"""" cannot be sent without authorization, and """"promotional calls"""" cannot be made without authorization. Through a series of clearer compliance guidelines and clearer legal responsibilities, we can make the market more orderly, make operations more standardized, prevent market failures, and reduce consumer infringements.",,,,
"Guo Qiwen, head of the Second Legislative Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, said that the regulations focus on current pain points and difficult issues that consumers are concerned about. Such as refining and supplementing the relevant provisions of the Consumer Rights Protection Law, improving the relevant provisions of online consumption, standardizing prepaid consumer business activities, strengthening the government\'s consumer rights protection responsibilities, clarifying the performance requirements of consumer associations, etc.",,,,
"Regarding the excessive collection and use of personal information by some apps, You Xueyun, head of the Cyber \u200b\u200bLaw and Regulation Bureau of the Cyberspace Administration of China, said that face recognition during online shopping is an excessive collection of personal information. Operators must not excessively collect consumers\' personal information, and must not use one-time general authorization, default authorization, etc. to force or disguise consumers to agree to the collection and use of personal information that is not directly related to business activities.",,,,
Break through pain points and blockages,,,,
"The Regulations have made special provisions for consumption pain points such as prepaid consumption, live streaming, """"one old and one young"""", """"overlord clauses"""", """"fake orders and speculation"""", """"big data to kill mature people"""", automatic renewal, and forced tying. Regulation.",,,,
"Kuang Xu, director of the Law Enforcement and Inspection Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that in response to the characteristics and outstanding problems of live streaming, the regulations have made various regulations. For example, when bringing goods in a live broadcast, it is necessary to clearly state “who is bringing the goods” and “whose goods are being brought” and make it clear that “everyone is responsible” for the platform, live broadcast room and anchor. Live broadcast marketing platform operators should establish and improve a consumer rights protection system and strictly implement it. Identity verification and daily management responsibilities, and clear consumer dispute resolution mechanism.",,,,
"All kinds of chaos in prepaid consumption have become obstacles to safe consumption. Kuang Xu said that the regulations gave consumers the right to terminate the contract for the first time. What operators have to refund is not only the balance of the advance payment, but also based on the performance of the contract and the situation of breach of contract.",,,,
"The regulations also have corresponding provisions on deposits. Unreasonable conditions must not be set for the return of deposits. Those who meet the conditions must be returned in time. When a consumer defaults, the operator should use the actual loss as the standard for deducting the deposit, rather than simply """"all or nothing"""". In addition, the regulations set up special penalties for prepaid consumption, which are clearly imposed by relevant administrative departments. Those who charge fees in advance and then run away with the money will also be included in the list of serious illegal and untrustworthy persons in accordance with the law.",,,,
"""""Overlord clauses"""" are common problems encountered by consumers, such as """"orders are non-refundable and non-exchangeable"""", """"registration is deemed to be consent"""", """"jurisdiction is limited to local areas"""" and other unfair format clauses.",,,,
"Kuang Xu said that the regulations focus on """"overlord clauses"""", such as stipulating that operators shall not use standard clauses to unreasonably exempt or reduce their responsibilities, increase consumers\' responsibilities, or restrict consumers from changing or rescinding contracts, choosing litigation, or The right to arbitrate consumer disputes and choose goods or services from other operators.",,,,
"Chen Yifang, president of the First Civil Trial Division of the Supreme People\'s Court, said that the Supreme People\'s Court is conducting research on issues such as online tipping, online live broadcast marketing, online booking, and consumer personal information protection. The next step will be to release typical cases in a timely manner and formulate judicial Policies and other means continue to increase judicial protection of consumer rights and interests.",,,,
Improve the resolution mechanism,,,,
What to do when consumer disputes occur is a practical issue that consumers are concerned about. Kuang Xu said that the regulations have improved the consumer dispute resolution mechanism.,,,,
"The regulations require operators to implement first-order responsibility, which embodies the orientation of """"whoever sells is responsible"""", """"whoever serves is responsible"""" and """"whoever is in charge protects rights"""". Consumers have the right to directly approach sellers and service providers. After relevant administrative departments accept complaints, if operators and consumers agree to mediate, they should mediate in a timely manner in accordance with their duties.",,,,
"In addition, the regulations also stipulate the requirements for accepting complaints, time limits, entrusted mediation, identification and testing and other procedures. For example, consumer disputes that are major, complex, and involve many people can be included in the government\'s random inspections, so as to """"identify once and resolve them all."""" This is also It alleviates the pain points that consumers often report that identification is expensive and difficult.",,,,
"Kuang Xu said that both consumers and operators are important participants in the market, and both parties must uphold the principle of good faith and conduct civil activities within the rule of law. The regulations stipulate that complaints and reports should abide by laws, regulations and relevant provisions, and those who obtain compensation by fraud or extortion must bear administrative liability or even criminal liability; punitive compensation and administrative penalty systems must be accurately applied to avoid """"small mistakes, big compensation"""" and """"small excesses."""" punishment"""".",,,,
"On September 25, Xinhua News Agency authorized the release of the """"Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Implementing an Employment-First Strategy to Promote High-Quality and Full Employment"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Opinions"""").",,,,
Main contents of the Opinion: Five major measures to promote high-quality full employment,,,,
"The """"employment priority strategy"""" has been included in the national five-year plan three times since the """"12th Five-Year Plan"""", but it has not been implemented in lower-level laws. In the national economic and social development plans since 2020, although the employment goal has a high status and is usually ranked second among all goals after GDP growth, it was only arranged separately in the form of a special column in 2023. The issuance of the """"Opinion"""" and the emphasis on the implementation of the """"employment priority strategy"""" is the first time that the employment priority strategy has been implemented in lower-level laws, which means that the importance of the current employment goal has been further enhanced.",,,,
"The Opinions contain six articles and 24 items, covering five policies to promote employment: First, promote the coordinated linkage between economic and social development and employment promotion, and propose measures to promote employment from the aspects of macroeconomic regulation, modern industrial system, business entities, regional coordination, and new momentum; Second, focus on solving structural employment contradictions, and put forward opinions mainly from the perspectives of education supply, vocational skills training, and skilled talent development; Third, improve the employment support system for key groups, and put forward corresponding employment support measures for groups such as college graduates, youth, retired soldiers, rural labor, people in difficulties, and flexible employment personnel; Fourth, improve the precise and efficient employment public service system, and put forward the requirements for full coverage of employment public services, consolidation of grassroots orientation, and promotion of digital empowerment; At the same time, it also puts forward requirements such as guaranteeing equal employment rights, promoting reasonable growth of labor remuneration, building harmonious labor relations, and expanding social security coverage. Fifth, gather the work force to promote high-quality and full employment, and put forward opinions on organizational work.",,,,
The Opinions will help maintain job market expectations and stabilize social confidence.,,,,
"Since 2024, the recovery momentum of the domestic economy has been weak, structural employment pressure has continued to increase, and labor intensity has increased significantly, which is inconsistent with the goal of high-quality employment. In August 2024, the surveyed urban unemployment rate rose to 5.3%, while the surveyed unemployment rate of the labor force aged 16-24, excluding school students, has reached 18.8% (Chart 1). Both indicators have climbed for two consecutive months. Social employment The pressure continues to build. At the same time, the weekly working hours of enterprise employees has also climbed from less than 46 hours before the epidemic to more than 48 hours (Chart 2). The employment environment has deteriorated and is incompatible with what is usually defined by academic circles as “stability, good remuneration and environment, and There is a gap in the high-quality employment goals of """"opportunities for advancement and development, and a relative balance between work and life.""""",,,,
"The poor employment environment, coupled with the implementation of delayed retirement, has further affected residents\' income expectations and consumer confidence, which is not conducive to the stability of the social and economic environment. In the past two years, multiple factors such as the scar effect after the epidemic, the negative wealth effect of falling housing prices, and low income expectations have long suppressed residents\' willingness to consume. Recently, the implementation of the delayed retirement policy has triggered social concerns that """"older workers will squeeze out young workers"""", further affecting residents\' and the market\'s expectations.",,,,
"Against the backdrop of increasing employment pressure and significant impact on social expectations, the release of the """"Opinion"""" will undoubtedly convey the government\'s determination to take multiple measures to stabilize the employment market and help reverse the pessimistic expectations in the market.",,,,
The problem with the loan is structural:,,,,
"1) The growth rate of residential mortgage loans has been around 5%, which is generally consistent with the real estate sales trend behind it;",,,,
"2) The biggest pressure on the margin is corporate loans. The premise is that corporate loans have just gone through a very abundant period. Even at the beginning of 2023, the growth rate of corporate loans reached a new high in 11 years. However, these formed There is no linear demand matching for real assets, so the current slowdown in corporate loans is a natural decline process.",,,,
"From this structure, we can see that the elasticity of corporate demand for funds at the macro level has disappeared:",,,,
"1) In 2022, capital expenditures in the manufacturing industry will stem from the liquidity squeezed out by real estate, but currently, even if real estate continues to squeeze out liquidity, the investment and financing needs of enterprises will not rise accordingly;",,,,
"2) Therefore, this remaining liquidity can only be supplemented by the government. Therefore, we have seen government bonds rise again, and the performance of social financing is stronger than the loans themselves.",,,,
"But we must also admit that enterprises are not a highly homogeneous group, and their internal polarization is also very obvious. For example, trust loans continue to accelerate, which reflects the demand for liquidity by enterprises below the waist regardless of cost.",,,,
"In a total sense, the market part of financing may continue to shrink, but this does not necessarily represent the subsequent growth of economic pressure. Even if corporate capital expenditures decline, if the inventory cycle gradually accelerates, it can also offset corporate fixed investment. Part of this loss, for example, the recovery of the economic cycle in 2016-2017 was completed in an environment where corporate investment and financing continued to decline.",,,,
"Another issue that needs to be considered is: after 2014, the market-oriented color of finance was gradually stripped away, and the role of finance changed from a businessman who made money for local governments to a counter-cyclical regulator from God's perspective. Then, once As the middle and upper reaches circulate and the economy stabilizes at the margin, the fiscal department may not use the increasing amount of remaining liquidity to invest, but may consider deficit ratio and stability issues more. At this time, government financing is not We must choose to support the financing cycle.",,,,
"In this case, economic stabilization and residual liquidity will coexist. The flattening of the bond yield curve we have seen recently is already a consequence of residual liquidity. In this environment, although the financing cycle is fragile, Easing monetary policy is also unlikely.",,,,
"These characteristics are reflected in asset allocation, and the situation becomes more complicated:",,,,
"1) Once the flexibility of funding interest rates fails, asset allocation opportunities may return to bonds;",,,,
"2) However, due to the impact of regulation, residual liquidity will not always exist, which will lead to short-term and disorderly opportunities for interest rate bonds;",,,,
"3) While these trends are not favorable for the equity market, the equity market is currently low enough to allow for some minor bargain hunting.",,,,
"The recovery of domestic consumer demand has fallen short of expectations, and domestic macroeconomic policies have fallen short of expectations.",,,,
"Recently, the Cyberspace Administration of China, together with the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the State Administration of Radio and Television, announced the """"Regulations on the Governance of Internet Violence Information"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Regulations"""").

Investment will boost the profitability of industrial enterprises. Profitability of the raw material processing industry improved. The profit contribution of the equipment manufacturing industry continues to narrow.,,,,
"According to information on the website of the National Bureau of Statistics on December 27, from January to November 2023, the total profit of industrial enterprises above designated size nationwide was 6.98228 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 4.4%, and the decline continued to narrow by 3.4 percentage points from January to October; The profits of industrial enterprises above designated size rose by 29.5% year-on-year, and the growth rate accelerated significantly by 26.8 percentage points from October. In terms of operating income and costs, the operating income of industrial enterprises from January to November increased by 1.0% year-on-year, continuing to improve by 0.7 percentage points from January to October. The operating income per 100 yuan of assets was 80.8 yuan, an increase of 0.6 yuan from January to October. . The operating costs of industrial enterprises increased by 1.1% year-on-year from January to November, and the growth rate accelerated by 0.5 percentage points from January to October.",,,,
"In terms of profitability, the operating income profit margin of industrial enterprises above designated size from January to November was 5.8%, continuing to increase by 0.2 percentage points from January to October; the total profits of industrial enterprises fell by 4.4% year-on-year, and the decline continued to narrow by 3.4% from January to October. percentage points.",,,,
"From the perspective of """"volume"""" and """"price"""", the restoration of production activities was the main contributor to the profit growth that month. The year-on-year growth rate of industrial added value in November was 6.6%, which was significantly faster than October by 2.0 percentage points. However, it should be noted that the price side remains relatively weak. In November, the price of industrial products was stable but declined. The year-on-year decreases in PPI and production materials PPI were both 0.4 percentage points higher than in October. The increase in industrial production volume and the decrease in price in November indicate to a certain extent that the downstream demand of industrial enterprises has moderately recovered, which has led to the improvement of corporate operating efficiency.",,,,
"In terms of manufacturing, total manufacturing profits from January to November fell by 4.7% year-on-year, and the decline continued to narrow by 3.8 percentage points from January to October. Its proportion in the total profits of industrial enterprises above designated size continued to rise slightly to 73.0%, continuing to hit a record high. The highest level during the year, and the profit structure of industrial enterprises continued to improve. Specific to sub-sectors, the profits of the raw material processing industry continued to improve from January to November, and the negative contribution to the cumulative year-on-year growth of total profits of industrial enterprises narrowed to 3.5 percentage points, which continued to narrow by 2.2 percentage points from January to October; black and non-ferrous metals The metal smelting and rolling processing industry is an important contributor, driving the total profit of industrial enterprises in the current period to a cumulative year-on-year growth rate of 0.8 and 0.6 percentage points.",,,,
"Investment will boost the profitability of industrial enterprises. The profit structure of industrial enterprises continued to improve in November, and the proportion of manufacturing profits continued to rise. In terms of trends, the profit structure continues to tilt towards the manufacturing industry, while the profit structure within the manufacturing industry continues to diverge.",,,,
"We believe that the investment side is actively promoting a recovery in the profit performance of industrial companies. In terms of upstream, from January to November, the profit growth rate of the raw material processing industry continued to recover overall, and the ferrous and non-ferrous metal processing industry made a significant contribution; in addition to strong support from manufacturing and infrastructure investment, new real estate construction may be playing a positive role, 1 -The area of \u200b\u200bnewly started housing construction in November fell by 21.5% year-on-year. The decline has narrowed for four consecutive months. Three major projects such as affordable housing construction are expected to play a positive and stabilizing role on the demand side. In terms of midstream and downstream, according to our calculations, the actual growth rate of profits of midstream and downstream industrial enterprises from January to November was 3.2%, which was the same as last month; with the active implementation of investment-side policies such as special government bonds and taking effect, investment in China is ready to go next year. The focus of profit improvement of downstream companies will fall more on the consumer side, and """"consumption-promoting"""" policies need to be further strengthened.",,,,

"The ESG concept is a reflection of the concept of sustainable development at the micro level of an enterprise. With the changes in investors\' values \u200b\u200band the evolution of the relationship between social responsibility and investment returns, ESG investment has gradually developed into the backbone of promoting sustainable development. However, corporate ESG information covers many factors. How to outline and grasp the key points to conduct a scientific and reasonable evaluation of the company\'s ESG performance has become a difficult problem faced by investors in practicing ESG concepts. In order to measure corporate ESG performance or value and alleviate the information asymmetry between investors and companies, ESG ratings came into being. ESG ratings can promote reform, guide investment, and promote policy implementation through evaluation. They are the baton guiding the scientific development of ESG. At present, many domestic and foreign institutions have been involved in the field of ESG ratings. However, there are significant differences in the quality and practicality of ESG ratings from different institutions, making it difficult to guide specific investments and corporate ESG practices.",,,,
"Many third-party institutions at home and abroad have carried out useful explorations related to ESG ratings. The methodologies of these institutions for ESG ratings are basically the same, but there are certain differences in the design of specific indicators and weight distribution. Among them, the ESG rating indicator system is a concrete manifestation of ESG core values \u200b\u200band the basis for ESG investment. This article summarizes the setting of domestic ESG rating topics. As far as the ESG rating system is concerned, the first-level indicators are generally the three macro dimensions of environment, society and corporate governance; the last-level indicators are the underlying micro-data indicators, and the number generally ranges from dozens to hundreds.",,,,

"At 23:00 on the evening of January 3, Beijing time, the U.S. ISM released manufacturing PMI data for December.",,,,
"The U.S. manufacturing PMI continues to be sluggish, and active destocking is a significant drag",,,,
"The U.S. manufacturing PMI continues to be sluggish. In December, the U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI recorded 47.4, slightly higher than market expectations of 47.1. It rose 0.7 points from the previous value of 46.7, and has been in contraction territory for the fourteenth consecutive month. PMI has been in a narrow range of fluctuations at the bottom since June, and the recovery trend is still unclear. In December, among the five sub-items of the ISM manufacturing PMI, only the production item was above the boom and bust line, and the new orders, own inventory, employment, and supplier delivery indexes were all below 50.",,,,
"Active destocking has a significant drag on PMI. The new orders index dragged down the PMI index by 0.2 points, the highest drag, and self-owned inventory dragged down 0.1 percentage points. Both demand and inventory fell, indicating that the manufacturing industry is still affected by active destocking. In terms of pull items, the employment index pulled up 0.5 percentage points, the production index pulled up 0.4 percentage points, and the supplier delivery index pulled up 0.2 percentage points. The production side performed better than the demand side, and the manufacturing industry was more dragged down by the demand side.",,,,
"The gap between the manufacturing industry and the service industry is still widening. The service PMI index was 52.7 in November, which was 6 points higher than the manufacturing PMI reading. The difference between the two is still widening. The main components of the service industry are better than the manufacturing industry. The service industry price index is 12 points higher than the manufacturing industry, and the new orders index is 8 points higher. Export orders in the service industry dropped from 63.7 in September to 53.6 in November, but the new orders index reflecting demand in the service industry has been at a high of 55-58 in the past six months. Manufacturing demand is sluggish and employment continues to shrink",,,,
"New orders, export orders, and inventory orders on the demand side are all in contraction range. New orders fell 1.2 percentage points to 47.1 in December, and new export orders were 49.9.",,,,
"Stock order is 45.3. In terms of domestic demand, the growth rate of new orders for durable goods in the United States picked up in November, but it was mainly driven by transportation equipment and the spillover effect was not strong. In terms of external demand, U.S. export growth continued to weaken. Merchandise exports in November were -3.3% year-on-year, compared with -2.5% in October. The export growth rates of automobiles, consumer goods, and intermediate goods all declined.",,,,
"Customer inventory backlog has not been significantly alleviated. The self-owned inventory index of manufacturing enterprises in December was 44.3, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous value. The customer inventory index fell 2.7 points to 48.1 in December, still at the highest level in the past two years, indicating that the customer inventory backlog has not significantly improved. The manufacturing customer inventory index mainly reflects the inventory situation of downstream enterprises and is in sync with the inventory sales of retailers. Currently, customer inventories are still at a high level, and the momentum for a recovery in total demand may be weak.",,,,
"The production index has improved and employment remains in contraction territory. The production index rebounded to 50.3 in December from the previous value of 48.5. The employment index was 48.1, compared with the previous value of 45.8, an increase of 2.3 points, but still in the contraction range. The supplier delivery index rose to 47.0 from the previous value of 46.2. The contraction in the PMI employment index may indicate that non-farm employment still tends to weaken. U.S. ADP manufacturing employment decreased by 15,000 people in November, and non-farm employment increased by 200,000 people in November, which is lower than the average level in the past three months.",,,,
"The price index fell, and the pressure for inflation to rebound was low. The PMI price sub-item in December was recorded at 45.2, down from 49.9 in the previous month, down 4.7 points. Looking backward, the pressure for inflation to rebound is still low. On the one hand, the PMI price index is ahead of the PPI month-on-month and CPI month-on-month. Since May, the PMI price index has fluctuated within a narrow range, and both are below the boom-bust line, with insufficient upward momentum; on the other hand, , new orders, export orders, etc. are still weak, and the risk of demand-side rebound may be relatively low.",,,,
"The stock and bond markets responded mutedly, while OIS implied interest rates rose slightly.",,,,
"The stock and bond markets reacted relatively flatly to PMI. The U.S. manufacturing PMI data was slightly higher than market expectations, while the job vacancy data released in November was slightly lower than market expectations. The two combined, the stock market, bond market and the U.S. dollar reacted relatively mutedly. However, due to concerns that the Federal Reserve monetary minutes released in the early morning of the 4th were hawkish, the overall stock market weakened that day. As of the close, the Nasdaq fell 1.2%, the S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow fell 0.8%, and the U.S. dollar index rose 0.2% to 102.",,,,
"Implied interest rates in the futures market rose slightly. The PMI data was slightly higher than market expectations. The federal funds rate implied by the OIS rose slightly by 2.6 BP compared with before the data was released. However, the current implied policy rate is still lower than the level in early December, indicating that the market is still optimistic about the Fed's interest rate cut. The market has priced in the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in March, cutting interest rates 5 times throughout the year, totaling about 125 BP. The expected probability of a rate cut in March has reached 67%. Interest rate cut expectations are relatively radical, and there may be a risk of rebound in the short term.",,,,
Geopolitical risks intensify; commodity prices rebound; wage growth slows less than expected,,,,
"There was a net withdrawal of 17 billion yuan from the open market last week, and 22 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repos expired this week",,,,
"Last week (March 16, 2024 - March 22, 2024), the central bank withdrew a net 17 billion yuan from the open market, of which 22 billion yuan was invested in 7-day reverse repos, 39 billion yuan expired, and the interest rate was maintained at 1.80%; Weekly (March 23, 2024 - March 29, 2024), 22 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repurchase expires, 50 billion yuan of treasury cash fixed deposits expire, and 5 billion yuan of central bank bill swaps expire in 3 months Expect.",,,,
"The spread between R007 and DR007 increased slightly, and the exchange repurchase rate rose.",,,,
"The average value of R001 is 2.00%, an increase of 6.86BP from the previous week, and the average value of DR001 is 1.77%, an increase of 2.45BP from the previous week. The average weighted average price of DR007 is 1.87%, a decrease of 1.10BP from the previous week. The average weighted average price of R007 was 2.15%, an increase of 13.02BP from the previous week. The closing price difference between the two (R007-DR007) closed at 0.13BP, an increase of 0.23BP from the previous week. The exchange repurchase rate increased, with the average value of GC007 being 2.16%, an increase of 14.02BP from the previous week.",,,,
"The total issuance of interbank certificates of deposit decreased, and the average coupon rate rose slightly",,,,
"Last week, the maturity amount of interbank certificates of deposit decreased to 725.75 billion yuan (988.75 billion yuan the previous week), the number of issuances increased to 696, and the actual total issuance was 1.12639 billion yuan (665.790 billion yuan the previous week). The average coupon rate increased by 1.32BP to 2.23%. .",,,,
"Risk warning: Policies exceed expectations, financial supervision exceeds expectations, etc.",,,,
"One of the hotly debated topics in the market recently is interest rate cuts. At the domestic level, starting from December 21, commercial banks will lower their deposit interest rates for the third time this year, which not only relieves the pressure on banks' net interest margins, but also opens up space for interest rate cuts in 2024. The current real interest rates are on the high side, and economic recovery also depends on further reductions in interest rates. Overseas, the December Federal Reserve interest rate meeting officially discussed interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve officially guided to cut interest rates by 75 BP by the end of 2024. The market is ahead of the curve and has already factored in expectations for a 150 BP interest rate cut throughout the year.",,,,
"From the DDM formula, the factors that affect stock prices mainly include corporate profits (the logic of the numerator) and the discount factor (the logic of the denominator). Theoretically, falling interest rates drive risk-free interest rates down from the denominator side, boosting the stock market through increased valuations. However, judging from historical experience, specific conditions are required for denominator logic to work. During the downward phase of domestic interest rates, A-shares fall most of the time. U.S. stocks show similar characteristics. Before and after the start of the Fed's previous interest rate cut cycles, U.S. stocks generally underperformed U.S. bonds. The reason is that when the risk-free interest rates on the denominator side of China and the United States fall, it usually corresponds to increased downward pressure on the economy and pressure on corporate profits. The numerator side also falls, which significantly offsets the logic of the denominator side.",,,,
"When the economy is at the bottom of the profit cycle, the market is relatively blunt on the numerator, and the logic of the denominator is easier to realize. When earnings growth approaches bottom, the market is usually more passive on the profit side, and denominator trends caused by falling interest rates are more likely to occur. Judging from the historical experience of A-shares, the impact of interest rates on valuations and the market is usually more prominent when earnings growth is close to a bottom. 2008-2009, 2014-2015, 2019Q1, and 2020 are more typical.",,,,
"The current position is at the bottom of profitability, and with loose liquidity at home and abroad, the logic of the denominator is expected to be performed again. The turbulence of A-shares in the spring of 2024 is worth looking forward to. If we count from March 2021, the growth rate of all-A (non-financial) profits has been adjusted for nearly a year and a half, and profits are at the absolute bottom, and have rebounded slightly in the third quarter. The profits of industrial companies improved significantly in November, and according to our previous calculations, the growth rate of all-A (non-financial) profits in 2024 is expected to pick up quarter by quarter and be close to 7% by the end of the year. In the future, under the resonance of easing expectations at home and abroad, the probability of the denominator market happening again is not low, and the current position can be more optimistic.",,,,
"Risk warning: First, historical experience does not represent the future; second, economic recovery is lower than expected; third, overseas markets fluctuate significantly",,,,
Social finance is expected to maintain resilience during the year,,,,
"In October, china\'s new social financing was 1.85 trillion yuan (expected 1.83 trillion yuan), and new RMB loans were 0.74 trillion yuan (expected 0.64 trillion yuan), both of which were better than market expectations. M2 grew 10.3% year-on-year, slightly lower than expected (10.5%).",,,,
"First, the social financing and credit data were both better than market expectations, confirming the continued recovery and improvement of the economy. As the first month of the last quarter of the year, there are also fewer working days. October is usually a """"weak month"""" for financial data during the year. It is not easy to achieve such a performance. In addition, starting from August this year, financial data has been better than market expectations for three consecutive months.",,,,
"Second, we need to realize that although the total volume is good, there is still room for structural optimization. The contribution of various social financing subjects to the year-on-year increase in that month was ranked as follows: government bonds (contribution 137.9%), credit (contribution 13.8%), non-standard financing (contribution -8.9%) and direct financing (contribution -18.6%). It should be pointed out that the year-on-year increase in social financing mainly comes from the increase in government net financing brought about by the issuance of special refinancing bonds in October. These bonds mainly replace existing debt and will not directly stimulate economic growth. In addition, among the corporate loans that accounted for 70% (69.9%) of new loans, medium and long-term loans turned negative year-on-year. The support mainly came from bill discounting (an increase of 127.1 billion yuan year-on-year). After excluding this impact, credit financing performance will be lower than the market expected levels compared with the same period last year.",,,,
"The third is to pay attention to the efficiency of fund use. During the period of policy guidance of """"easing credit"""", the volatility of financial data increases. At this time, attention should be paid to the two major indicators of M2-M1 and social finance-M2. On the one hand, M2-M1 continued to expand in October, partly affected by the big month of tax payments (M1 growth rate declined further), but it also reflects that the efficiency of fund use is still weak. On the other hand, Sherong-M2 continued the trend of continuous repair since the beginning of the year, and the inversion amplitude of the scissors difference converged.",,,,
"Looking forward, social finance is expected to remain resilient during the year. On the one hand, as economic fundamentals continue to recover, it will endogenously drive improvement in financing demand; on the other hand, the issuance of special treasury bonds, remaining general treasury bonds and special refinancing bonds during the year (the net financing amount is expected to be approximately 1.8 trillion yuan) will still It will form a strong support for social integration.",,,,
"Risk warning: Demand does not improve as expected, and overseas economies enter recession.",,,,
Commodity Market Summary and Outlook,,,,
"Short-term long and short factors are intertwined, and the commodity index fluctuates",,,,
"On Friday (October 20), most domestic commodity futures closed lower, with most basic metals falling. Lithium carbonate fell more than 6%, and Shanghai nickel fell nearly 3%. Most black stocks fell, with iron ore falling more than 3%. Agricultural products Prices were mixed, with corn starch, rapeseed meal and soybean meal rising, rapeseed oil falling by nearly 3%, and Zheng cotton falling by more than 2%; most energy and chemical products rose, crude oil rose by nearly 2%, PVC and methanol rose by more than 1%; precious metals all rose , Shanghai gold rose more than 1%.",,,,
"Hot comment: The commodity index fell into a volatile trend last week, mainly due to the coexistence of long and short factors. On the one hand, the continued rise in U.S. bond interest rates suppressed risk appetite and triggered turmoil in the global capital market. On the other hand, the domestic economic recovery momentum increased, and Palestine and Israel The conflict has exacerbated supply-side vulnerabilities, supporting commodity prices.",,,,
"Looking forward, long and short factors are intertwined, and we should pay attention to the changes in """"breaking factors"""". Overseas, the U.S. economy still has strong resilience in the short term, and inflation still faces upward risks, which means that high interest rates will last longer. Higher interest rates will suppress the market\'s risk appetite in stages. Domestically, GDP grew by 4.9% in the third quarter, higher than market consensus, indicating that the endogenous driving force for economic recovery is growing. However, the drag on real estate is still large, considering the contribution of the real estate industry chain to commodity demand. The degree is relatively high, and we still need to pay attention to the development of the real estate market. In terms of geopolitical factors, in an environment of generally low inventory of commodities, geopolitical conflicts have intensified the vulnerability of the supply side, and the future direction of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will have a greater influence.",,,,
1. Black building materials: There is a risk of negative feedback in the short term.,,,,
"From a macro perspective, economic data in the third quarter were significantly better than market expectations, with GDP growing by 4.9% and most major sub-indicators improving. However, real estate remains weak. At the same time, considering that it is not difficult to achieve the 5% target within the year, the market is worried that the policy to stabilize growth may no longer be effective, which in turn leads to weaker market sentiment.",,,,
"From a fundamental point of view, last week’s data from Ganggu.com and Steel Federation showed that steel mill output declined slightly, surface demand rebounded seasonally after the holidays, and inventories continued to be reduced. Halfway through the peak season of the Gold-9-Silver-10-year period, the demand for steel is tepid (downstream real estate companies are less enthusiastic about acquiring land, and new construction starts are at a low level). Steel mill profits are on the verge of loss due to the compression of raw materials, and the motivation to reduce production has increased. There is a greater risk of negative feedback in the black industry in the short term.",,,,
"2. Basic metals: short-term rebound, but the upper pressure remains.",,,,

"4. Question: Promoting high-quality development of the capital market is inseparable from the joint efforts of all parties. What arrangements does the """"Opinions"""" have in this regard?",,,,

"On March 22, the Ministry of Commerce issued the """"Special Management Measures for Cross-Border Services Trade (Negative List)"""" (2024 Edition) and the """"Special Management Measures for Cross-Border Services Trade in Pilot Free Trade Zones (Negative List)"""" (2024 Edition). The heads of the Department of Trade in Services and Free Trade Zone Port Department of the Ministry of Commerce answered reporters’ questions on issues related to the two versions of the negative list.",,,,
1. What is the background for the issuance of the national version and the free trade pilot zone version of the negative list for cross-border trade in services? What significance does the issuance and implementation of two versions of the list have for China\'s expansion of high-level opening up to the outside world?,,,,
Implementing a negative list for cross-border trade in services across the country is an important measure for China to proactively align with international high-standard economic and trade rules and promote institutional openness. It is also a practical action for China to share development opportunities with the world and promote the construction of an open world economy.,,,,
"At the previous China International Fair for Trade in Services, President Xi Jinping proposed establishing and improving a negative list management system for cross-border services trade, promoting the implementation of a negative list for cross-border services trade nationwide and in free trade pilot zones, improving the level of openness of cross-border services trade, and building a high-level The standard service industry opening system has issued a series of important instructions. The Ministry of Commerce, together with relevant units, has conscientiously implemented it, and based on the pioneering exploration of the Hainan Free Trade Port in 2021, it has formulated and issued a negative list for cross-border service trade applicable to the whole country and the free trade pilot zone, and expanded opening up on a wider scale.",,,,
"The implementation of the national version and the free trade pilot zone version of the negative list for cross-border service trade marks the first time that a negative list management model for cross-border service trade has been established nationwide, forming a gradient opening system for cross-border service trade. It can be said that this is a major reform of china\'s service trade management system and a major measure for china to expand high-level opening up to the outside world. It fully demonstrates China\'s determination and direction to persist in deepening reform and expanding opening up, and will also provide innovative cooperation for the opening up of global services trade. New opportunities.",,,,
2. What are the main considerations in formulating two versions of the negative list?,,,,
"In formulating the national version and the free trade pilot zone version of the negative list, the following aspects are mainly considered:",,,,
"The first is to align with international high-standard economic and trade rules. In the WTO\'s General Agreement on Trade in Services, international trade in services is divided into four modes: cross-border delivery, overseas consumption, commercial presence and movement of natural persons. Commercial existence is based on the service trade provided by the establishment of foreign investment institutions, and the other three modes are collectively referred to as cross-border service trade. Since 2013, China has continuously improved the level of investment liberalization by formulating, publishing and continuously reducing the """"Negative List for Foreign Investment Access"""", fully implementing the pre-admission national treatment plus negative list management system for foreign investment. In terms of cross-border trade in services, we mainly grant market access and national treatment to other contracting parties or participants based on the commitments made in the international treaties or agreements concluded, and most of these commitments are made in the form of a positive list. Currently, the negative list model has become a major way for international high-standard free trade agreements to make open arrangements in the field of cross-border service trade. The two versions of the lists released today are to proactively adopt the negative list model to uniformly manage market access for cross-border service trade, laying the foundation for better alignment with international high-standard economic and trade rules in the next step.",,,,
"The second is to reflect high-level opening requirements. In the past decade, international trade in services has developed rapidly. The average annual growth rate of global cross-border trade in services is 1.5 times the growth rate of trade in goods during the same period, and its proportion in global trade has increased to 22%. With the rapid breakthroughs in digital technology and the in-depth development of digital transformation in various fields, the potential of cross-border service trade will be further stimulated and become an important engine for global trade growth. The scale of China\'s services trade ranks among the top in the world, and the market potential is huge. We have implemented a negative list for cross-border trade in services across the country, collecting and listing the access measures that were scattered in various specific industries in the form of """"one list"""", and clarifying the areas outside the list, and restricting domestic and foreign services and services. Suppliers are managed according to the principle of internal and external consistency, which greatly improves the transparency and predictability of cross-border service trade management. At the same time, in light of development realities and opening-up needs, we have made further opening-up arrangements for natural persons’ professional qualifications, professional services, finance, culture and other fields in the Pilot Free Trade Zone, and proactively expanded opening-up. This fully demonstrates China’s unswerving determination to expand opening-up, and also It reflects China’s direction of promoting institutional openness.",,,,
"The third is to coordinate development and security. We resolutely implement the requirements of the Party Central Committee on """"adhering to high-quality development and positive interaction with high-level security"""" and implement the overall national security concept. While expanding opening up in an orderly manner, we have also retained necessary special management measures in the list. After the list is released, various departments will strengthen institutional innovation, establish and improve the negative list management system, implement opening measures in relevant fields, improve supervision and risk prevention and control mechanisms, and continuously improve the level of governance under open conditions.",,,,
"In the next step, the Ministry of Commerce will work with various departments and localities to effectively implement the national version and the free trade pilot zone version of the cross-border service trade negative list, timely summarize and evaluate the implementation status, and insist on promoting high-quality development with high-level openness.",,,,
3. Please introduce the main contents of the two versions of the list?,,,,
"The negative list for cross-border trade in services is classified by national economic industry and uniformly lists special management measures for overseas service providers to provide services in a cross-border manner (through cross-border delivery, overseas consumption, and movement of natural persons). The national version and the free trade pilot zone version of the cross-border services trade negative list both involve agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, construction industry, wholesale and retail industry, transportation, warehousing and postal industry, information transmission, software and information technology service industry, and financial industry. , leasing and business services, scientific research and technical services, education, health and social work, culture, sports and entertainment and other 11 categories. Among them, there are 71 national negative lists for cross-border services trade and 68 free trade zone negative lists.",,,,
"4. In July 2021, with the consent of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the Ministry of Commerce issued the """"Special Management Measures for Cross-Border Services Trade in Hainan Free Trade Port (Negative List) (2021 Edition)"""". As China\'s first negative list in the field of cross-border services trade, how is the implementation of the Hainan version of the list and what results have been achieved?",,,,
"With the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the Ministry of Commerce issued the Hainan version of the list in July 2021, which will come into effect in August of that year.",,,,
"Since the implementation of the Hainan version of the list, the Ministry of Commerce has attached great importance to it and actively coordinated and promoted the implementation of the list. The first is to increase publicity efforts. By holding special press conferences, exclusive media interviews, and organizing experts to write articles, we conduct in-depth publicity and interpretation of the list and improve policy transparency. The second is to do a good job in training. Organize special training courses for Hainan Province, conduct systematic training for relevant staff, improve the capabilities and quality of the cadre team, and lay a solid foundation for the implementation of various opening measures in the list and risk prevention and control in open fields. At the same time, Hainan Province has also formulated and issued a work plan and management measures for the implementation of the list, formulated corresponding implementation details for the opening arrangements of the list, and established and improved a supporting management system.",,,,
"According to feedback from Hainan, the current implementation of the list in Hainan is generally good, and actual opening-up results have been achieved in many fields such as finance, transportation, legal services, and natural person professional qualifications. In the financial field, foreigners can already open securities accounts in Hainan to participate in transactions, and securities companies have hired foreign securities analysts to carry out securities transaction consulting services. In the field of transportation, many yachts from overseas can freely enter and exit Hainan ports, and it is no longer mandatory to apply for pilotage from china’s pilotage agency. In the field of legal services, Hainan law firms have hired foreign lawyers as foreign legal consultants to provide foreign legal consulting services. In the field of professional qualifications for natural persons, overseas individuals have applied to take qualification examinations such as practicing veterinarians.",,,,
"The implementation of the Hainan version of the list has effectively promoted the rapid growth of Hainan\'s service trade scale. According to Hainan statistics, Hainan Province\'s service import and export increased by 29.6% year-on-year in 2023, laying a practical foundation for the implementation of a negative list management system for cross-border service trade in the free trade pilot zone and nationwide.",,,,
5. What are the opening arrangements for the national and pilot free trade zone negative lists for cross-border trade in services respectively?,,,,
"The first national version of the list released this time mainly collects and lists the access measures that were scattered in various specific fields in the past in a """"one list"""". At the same time, it clarifies that areas outside the list are divided into domestic and overseas services and The implementation of management based on the principle of consistent treatment of service providers has realized the transformation of service trade management from positive list commitments to negative list management, effectively improving the transparency and predictability of cross-border service trade management. It can be said that it is a major opening-up initiative in itself.",,,,
"At the same time, based on actual development and opening-up needs, we have made further opening-up arrangements for natural persons’ professional qualifications, professional services, finance, culture and other fields in the Pilot Free Trade Zone:",,,,
"The first is to relax restrictions on professional qualification examinations. The list adopts a more open talent policy and removes restrictions on overseas individuals taking six professional qualification examinations, including registered urban and rural planners, real estate appraisers, auctioneers, survey and design registered engineers, veterinarians, and registered supervision engineers, which is conducive to encouraging and attracting More overseas professionals come to China to find jobs and start businesses, and participate in the construction of the pilot free trade zone, further enhancing the international level of the pilot free trade zone.",,,,
"The second is to expand the opening of the financial industry to the outside world. The Party Central Committee attaches great importance to the opening up of the financial field.

Focus on promoting high-level financial opening up to the outside world. Previously, we have piloted some opening-up measures in the Hainan Free Trade Port, and this time we will further expand the relevant opening-up measures to the Free Trade Pilot Zone. For example, allowing qualified overseas individuals to apply for opening securities accounts and futures accounts in accordance with the law will help attract more overseas individuals to participate in securities and futures investments, make china\'s capital market investors more diversified, and further enhance the vitality of the capital market. . For another example, allowing overseas individuals to apply for securities investment consulting and futures trading consulting services will help attract more overseas professional financial talents to provide services in the Free Trade Pilot Zone, enhance the supply capacity of high-quality financial services, and further enhance the financial sector. international level.",,,,
"The third is to expand the opening of the professional service industry to the outside world. The list removes restrictions on business entities established outside China and overseas individuals engaged in customs declaration business. In the future, overseas service providers can provide customs declaration services to entities in the free trade pilot zone in a cross-border manner without having to establish legal entities in china. This not only increases the freedom of overseas customs declaration enterprises to enter the domestic market, but also effectively reduces the The operating costs of enterprises will also help foreign trade enterprises in the pilot free trade zone to more conveniently utilize high-quality overseas services and enhance their international competitiveness.",,,,
"The fourth is to expand the opening of the cultural field to the outside world. The list relaxes the restrictions on the proportion of Chinese personnel in the main creative personnel of TV series jointly produced by China and foreign countries, and relaxes the proportion of Chinese personnel from the original no less than 1/3 to no less than 1/4, which is conducive to encouraging more outstanding foreign main creative personnel. Participate in the production of cooperative TV series to further promote international exchanges and cooperation in the field of radio and television.",,,,

"In terms of monetary policy, focus will be on the speech delivered by Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the Central Bank, at the Lujiazui Forum, as well as the second quarter regular meeting of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. Pan Gongsheng said that he will continue to adhere to a supportive monetary policy stance. In the future, we can consider clearly using a certain short-term operating interest rate of the central bank as the main policy interest rate; gradually including the purchase and sale of secondary market government bonds into the monetary policy toolbox; insisting on the decisive role of the market in the formation of exchange rates and maintaining exchange rate flexibility.",,,,
"The Q2 regular meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee emphasized financial structural support for entities. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to effectively implement various existing structural monetary policy tools, increase financial support for large-scale equipment updates and trade-in of consumer goods, and guide financial institutions to increase medium- and long-term loans for manufacturing industries with market demand; increase support for """"market+"""" """"Guarantee"""" financial support for the housing supply system and implement financial policies and measures to promote the healthy development of the platform economy.",,,,
"In terms of real estate policy, real estate policy focuses on the central government\'s promotion of the acquisition of existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing, guidance on local governments\' efforts to ensure the delivery of housing, and the continuation of local demand-side relaxation. The Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Cooperation Zone has relaxed purchase and sale restrictions; Beijing has implemented liberalization measures such as lowering down payment ratios, lowering mortgage interest rates, and increasing home purchase quotas for families with multiple children; Suzhou has implemented a home purchase and settlement policy.",,,,

Overseas macro policy: The Fed is divided on whether to cut interest rates this year,,,,
"In the past two weeks, overseas macro policies have mainly focused on the statements of Federal Reserve officials on monetary policy. Federal Reserve officials are still divided on whether to cut interest rates in 2024. Kashkari, Governor Kugler, Bostic and others believe that an interest rate cut may be carried out in 2024, possibly at the end of the year. Governor Bowman believes there may not be an interest rate cut in 2024. But Fed officials unanimously believe that a return to target inflation is a necessary condition for lowering interest rates.",,,,
"Risk warning: Domestic and foreign monetary policies continue to diverge, and domestic policy implementation is less than expected.",,,,
"Event: On April 30, 2024, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting to analyze and study the current economic situation and economic work.",,,,
"Core view: Judging from the content of the meeting, we believe that future real estate and interest rate policies may exceed expectations, and the two major constraints on current economic growth may change significantly. Among them, """"coordinating the study of policy measures to digest existing real estate and optimize incremental housing"""" may mean that greater efforts will be made to cancel purchase restrictions, relax mortgage conditions, reduce transaction taxes and fees, and increase the purchase of policy-based affordable housing. The Politburo meeting rarely mentioned """"flexible use of interest rates and deposit reserve ratio tools."""" Considering the current relative lack of domestic demand and historically low price levels, the RRR and interest rate cuts may exceed expectations. It is necessary to """"avoid tightening before tightening and then loosening later, and effectively consolidate and enhance the positive trend of economic recovery."""" """"It is necessary to issue and make good use of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds as soon as possible and accelerate the issuance and use of special bonds."""" """"Ensure that provinces, cities and counties with high debt risks are truly under pressure."""" """"Reducing debt and stabilizing development"""" may mean that fiscal intensification will be accelerated, and local governments may increase efforts to stabilize growth. In addition, new productivity, equipment upgrades, trade-in of consumer goods, green and low-carbon, and risk mitigation are expected to continue to be vigorously promoted, which may form significant support for related industries in the industrial field, as well as consumption of automobiles, home appliances, and home furnishings.",,,,
"Real estate policies may become more powerful, and """"destocking and optimizing growth"""" may be the core focus. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to """"coordinate the study of policies and measures to digest existing real estate and optimize incremental housing, and to build a new model of real estate development as soon as possible."""" We believe that greater efforts may be made to cancel purchase restrictions, relax mortgage conditions, reduce transaction taxes, and increase the purchase of policy-based affordable housing. Recently, Chengdu, Nanjing, Tianjin, Dalian and other places have successively optimized property market policies. Among them, Chengdu has completely canceled purchase restrictions, Nanjing has restarted the """"buy a house and settle down"""" policy, and Tianjin has canceled the city\'s household registration restrictions on the purchase of new houses with an area of \u200b\u200bmore than 120 square meters. From the perspective of inventory levels, the above-mentioned cities with relaxed property market policies have overall greater pressure to remove inventory. For example, the clearance cycle for commercial housing in Nanjing is nearly 24 months, and Chengdu and Tianjin both exceed 17 months. Inventories in Zhengzhou, Shenyang, Qingdao, Xiamen, etc. Future policies for cities under greater pressure may continue to intensify. In addition to relaxing demand-side policies such as relaxing purchase restrictions and lowering interest rates/taxes, the supply side can also promote the digestion of existing real estate and optimize the incremental housing structure by acquiring and building affordable housing and increasing the supply of high-quality housing. While solving the housing problems of new citizens and young people, it will promote the effective release of demand for improved housing purchases and promote the establishment of a new real estate development model supported by """"both rental and purchase"""". The meeting emphasized the need to """"effectively ensure the delivery of houses and protect the legitimate rights and interests of house buyers."""" In the first three months of this year, the growth rate of completed residential area across the country dropped significantly compared with last year. The problem of house delivery still affects the restoration of residents\' confidence in buying houses and brings risks to real estate companies. Data from the China Index shows that the overall gap between major leading real estate companies that have been sold and not completed is not large, but some small and medium-sized real estate companies may be under greater pressure to ensure the delivery of properties. At present, some measures have been introduced to ensure the handover of buildings, and it is expected that they will continue to be strengthened in the next step.",,,,
"The possibility of monetary policy cuts and interest rate cuts has increased. The meeting pointed out that """"policy tools such as interest rates and deposit reserve ratios must be flexibly used to increase support for the real economy and reduce comprehensive social financing costs."""" In terms of economic growth, my country\'s real GDP in the first quarter was 5.3% year-on-year, but the nominal growth rate was only 4.2%, and the GDP deflator has been negative for four consecutive quarters. During periods of low nominal growth, lower-than-normal interest rates are needed to boost consumption and investment demand and cause inflation to rise moderately. Comparing interest rates, since the second quarter of 2020, the spread between loan interest rates and financial market investment yields such as 10-year treasury bond yields, interbank certificates of deposit yields, and corporate bond yields has continued to narrow. In terms of investment performance-price ratio, the narrowing of interest rate spreads means that the relative attractiveness of financial products to funds has increased, which is not conducive to the flow of funds to the real economy and increases the possibility of funds idling in the financial system. Looking at real interest rates, since June 2020, China’s real interest rates have always been higher than those of the United States. As of March this year, China’s real interest rate (2.2%) was higher than the United States (0.7%), which has raised interest rates significantly. At the same time, China\'s current real interest rate level is also higher than the historical average. Higher real interest rates are not conducive to the expansion of corporate investment and household consumption, and may have a certain inhibitory effect on economic recovery. Combined with """"early issuance of ultra-long-term special government bonds and accelerated issuance of special bonds,"""" concentrated issuance of government bonds may create a backlog of liquidity. Previously, the deputy governor of the central bank stated that """"the statutory deposit reserve ratio still has room to decline."""" We believe that the probability of future RRR cuts and interest rate cuts is increasing, and the time and magnitude of interest rate cuts may exceed expectations.",,,,
"Fiscal efforts are expected to accelerate. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to """"avoid tightening in the first place and then loosening in the future, and effectively consolidate and enhance the positive economic recovery trend"""", """"it is necessary to issue and make good use of ultra-long-term special government bonds as soon as possible, and accelerate the issuance and use of special bonds."""" The pace of special bond issuance this year is relatively slow. According to Wind data, as of April 30, 722.4 billion yuan has been issued, with an issuance progress of 18.52%, compared with 42.67% in the same period last year. According to the official WeChat account of the National Development and Reform Commission on April 23, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance have completed the screening of local government special bond projects. Combined with the previous press conference of the State Council Information Office to promote the construction of all additional government bond issuance projects before the end of June this year, as well as the issuance and use of ultra-long-term special government bonds, multiple fiscal policies are expected to form a synergy to drive the recovery of domestic demand.",,,,
"Equipment updates and trade-in policies for consumer goods are being rolled out rapidly. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to actively expand domestic demand and implement large-scale equipment updates and consumer goods trade-in action plans. The State Council issued the """"Plan"""" on March 13. Since then, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Commerce have jointly issued multiple departments to issue detailed plans for equipment updates and trade-in of consumer goods. Recent policies have been further refined into products (national policy subsidies for automobiles, as well as many automobiles). Spontaneous subsidies from enterprises) and implemented at local level (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hunan and other places have issued specific measures). With the rollout of policies, the consumption of automobiles, home appliances, and home furnishings, as well as the support for investment in related manufacturing industries, may accelerate.",,,,
"Other key aspects. New productivity: The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to develop new productivity according to local conditions, and generally continue the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference and the Two Sessions. The development of new productivity is still an important way to get rid of the traditional economic growth mode and achieve high-quality development. This year, the number of high-tech industries has increased Value and fixed asset investment are both higher than the overall growth rate. The central bank has established relevant re-lending tools. Technology remains the focus of development. Green and low-carbon: The meeting pointed out that green and low-carbon development must be solidly promoted. We believe that the development direction is still the energy-saving and low-carbon upgrading and transformation of traditional industries. The new energy industry is developing rapidly. There may still be certain constraints on the production capacity of high-energy-consuming industries under the dual-carbon goals. . Debt risk: The meeting emphasized the need to ensure that provinces, cities and counties with high debt risks can truly reduce debt and develop stably. We believe that this setting of the tone has clarified the relationship between local government debt and development, and we may expect additional fiscal increases in the future. Policy support for local government funds.",,,,

"With the consent of the State Council, 10 departments including the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued the """"Opinions on Improving the Development Level of Processing Trade"""" (hereinafter referred to as the """"Opinions"""") on December 27, 2023. This is another important guiding policy document on the development of processing trade following the 2016 """"Several Opinions of the State Council on Promoting the Innovative Development of Processing Trade"""" (Guofa [2016] No. 4). Recently, the person in charge of the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Commerce interpreted the """"Opinions"""".",,,,
1. Background of the promulgation of the “Opinions”,,,,
"Processing trade is an important part of china\'s open economy and foreign trade. Since the reform and opening up, processing trade has achieved leapfrog development, making important contributions to driving employment, promoting the process of becoming a trading power, and promoting the upgrading of industrial structure. In recent years, the domestic and international environment has undergone profound changes, and the scale and proportion of traditional processing trade have also declined. However, this does not mean that the role of processing trade has been reduced. Processing trade is still driving the growth of foreign trade in the central, western and northeastern regions. The main driving force also plays a very important role in stabilizing foreign trade, foreign investment, and industrial and supply chains.",,,,
"The Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the development of processing trade and require that the level of processing trade be improved. The Ministry of Commerce conscientiously implemented the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and worked with relevant departments to conduct extensive and in-depth investigations and studies to draft the """"Opinions"""" and formulate relevant policies and measures. Recently, with the approval of the State Council, the """"Opinions"""" were officially issued and implemented.",,,,
2. Main contents of the “Opinions”,,,,
"The """"Opinions"""" put forward 12 policy measures from six aspects. First, in terms of encouraging the development of processing trade of high value-added products, measures such as supporting the development of processing trade in advanced manufacturing and strategic emerging industries and encouraging processing trade enterprises to make full use of the preferential policy of pre-tax super deduction for research and development expenses are proposed. Second, in terms of promoting the development of bonded maintenance business, two measures were proposed, including promoting the development of bonded maintenance business in comprehensive bonded zones and free trade pilot zones, and promoting bonded maintenance pilot projects in other areas. Third, in terms of guiding and supporting gradient transfer, three measures were proposed, including strengthening the construction of gradient transfer carriers, improving the docking cooperation mechanism for gradient transfer of processing trade, and increasing support for border areas. Fourth, in terms of strengthening fiscal and taxation financial support, it is proposed to make full use of existing funding channels such as special funds for foreign economic and trade development, and implement relevant tax preferential policies; increase credit support and export credit insurance support for processing trade enterprises to better meet the needs of enterprises. 2 measures including risk hedging and cross-border RMB settlement needs. Fifth, in terms of strengthening factor security, two measures were proposed, including strengthening transportation logistics and energy security, and meeting multi-level employment needs. Sixth, in terms of optimizing processing trade management and services, two measures are proposed: support the expansion of the domestic market and promote the integration of domestic and foreign trade; timely reduce the catalog of prohibited commodities in processing trade, further optimize relevant measures, and innovate the customs supervision mechanism.",,,,
"In the next step, the Ministry of Commerce will actively promote key tasks, improve supporting policies and measures, and work closely with relevant localities and departments to create a good policy environment for the sustainable and healthy development of processing trade.",,,,
"Since late February, pig prices, which have been sluggish for a long time, have shown a volatile upward trend. The spot price of live pigs has risen from 13.55 yuan/kg on February 23 to 14.92 yuan/kg (Boya Hexun.com), an increase of 10%. Over the same period The price of live pig futures rose from 14,655 yuan/ton to 15,545 yuan/ton, an increase of 6.1%. This phenomenon triggered the market\'s attention to the turning point of the pig cycle. The analysis found that the supply shrinkage caused by the slowdown in secondary fattening, slaughtering and slaughtering was the main reason, rather than the active rebound in demand.",,,,
"1. After the Spring Festival, the price difference between super fat pigs and standard pigs continues to widen, stimulating the breeding end to increase weight, and the sales of live pigs are converted into secondary fattening. From February 9 to March 15, the price difference between super fat pigs and standard pigs gradually widened from 0.27 yuan/kg to 0.85 yuan/kg in early March, and narrowed to 0.57 yuan/kg last week, but it is still Much higher than the average value of 0.35 yuan/kg in 2023. Under the influence of the widening price difference between fat prices, some breeding units choose to perform secondary fattening at periodic low prices, which leads to an increase in corporate purchase prices and tightens the supply of suitable-weight pigs to the slaughterhouse, thus pushing up pork prices. During the same period, the price difference between big fat pigs and standard pigs narrowed gently from 0.21 yuan/kg to 0.11 yuan/kg last week. This is mainly because after continuous weight gain, the current mainstream slaughter weight of the group\'s pig farms has gradually increased to the weight of big fat pigs. , the number of super-fat pigs is relatively small, and it takes time to gain weight, so the price difference between super-fat pigs and standard pigs is still large. In short, the persistence of fertilizer price differences will attract upstream secondary fattening activities to heat up, leading to a narrowing of pork supply in the short term.",,,,
"2. Slaughter sales have slowed down and slaughtering has declined, reflecting that upstream secondary fattening is still hot. In terms of the slaughter progress, as of March 20, the national average slaughter progress completion rate was 63.33%, which is a slightly slower pace overall. This is mainly related to the increase in pig prices and the group\'s move to slaughter after gaining weight. In terms of slaughter progress, February was affected by the Spring Festival effect. In March, the weekly slaughter volumes of the group and large-scale slaughterhouses reached more than 800,000 and 500,000 respectively. The slaughter volumes in the first week of March were 868,000 and 559,000 respectively. The slaughter volumes were 825,000 and 505,000 respectively, down 5% and 9.7% respectively from the previous month. While the overall slaughter situation is stable, the slaughter volume has declined significantly, reflecting that the enthusiasm for secondary fattening in the upstream is still high, resulting in a short-term decline in pork supply.",,,,
"Price observation this week: Coking coal and coke bottomed out this week and rebounded. On the demand side, molten iron production remained ultra-low due to the recovery of construction demand being significantly less than expected. The gap between steel mills\' production and sales is still urgent to drive down the price of furnace materials; the spot price of ferrous metals rebounded, and demand recovery is expected to boost Steel market; non-ferrous metals as a whole continued to fluctuate and rise. At this stage, we are in the peak season window period for piglets and secondary fattening, and most breeding entities have continued rolling operations to support the rising prices during the week; the weather continues to be sunny and warm, which is beneficial to all aspects of fruit and vegetable production, leading to rising prices for fruits and vegetables. Weakness.",,,,
"Looking ahead: Commodity prices may continue to fluctuate. In the black sector, current market pressure still exists, and there are many inhibitory factors for the continued rebound in prices. Last week, the inventory levels of the five major steel varieties exceeded the highs of the previous two years. With steel mills\' profits at low levels, output continued to decline, and raw material replenishment did not unfold as market expectations. In addition, the current recovery rate of construction steel is still slow, and the market It is expected that some infrastructure projects will start """"weakly"""" or """"lately"""", and there will be limited room for improving supply and demand fundamentals in the short term. With the arrival of the rainy season in the south, the destocking of steel products may slow down, which will also bring some restraint to the rebound in spot prices. In the non-ferrous sector, downstream automobiles, home appliances, photovoltaics, electronics, etc. continue to boost the demand for metals such as copper and aluminum. It is almost a high probability that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates during the year. Geopolitics has disrupted the supply of aluminum and nickel, which has superimposed low inventories in most cases. The weak US dollar corresponds to global demand. When things pick up, metal prices are easy to rise but hard to fall. In terms of crude oil: OPEC\'s major oil-producing countries have a strong willingness to reduce production and support prices. Geographical conflicts and the Red Sea crisis have also added more disturbances to crude oil supply. Domestic and foreign travel demand continues to pick up. The development and penetration of new energy will take some time. In the short term, , The medium and long-term supply gap still exists, and oil prices are still supported.",,,,
"Food prices may continue to fall. We are currently in the off-season for consumption, with poor terminal demand for pork and a general trading atmosphere. There is no positive support for the demand market in the short term. Pork sales may still be average. However, after secondary breeding or piglet replenishment becomes more active in the later period, pigs will still be sold for slaughter. Attention needs to be paid to the fact that the short-term pig price is expected to adjust weakly; although most areas in the central and eastern regions will be affected by rainfall and cold air next week, the duration will be short-lived. With the arrival of vegetables in various places, the vegetable price index is expected to continue to run smoothly next week.",,,,
Q1 weak recovery margin improvement Q2 chain momentum will increase,,,,
"The domestic economy will improve marginally in the first quarter of 2024, but the recovery will generally be weak. From January to February, the economy continued the low level of prosperity in the fourth quarter of 2023, but in March it rebounded beyond expectations. In the first quarter, the domestic production side recovered better than the demand side, which restricted the upward momentum of industrial product prices. At present, the lack of motivation to improve domestic demand in china is still a key issue restricting economic growth. Positive policies still need to be gradually implemented to stimulate endogenous motivation. The GDP growth rate in the first quarter is expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of last year and the same period last year, and is expected to be around 4.4%.",,,,
"In the second quarter, driven by the acceleration of the construction of the """"Three Major Projects"""", a new round of large-scale equipment upgrades, and the policy of replacing old consumer goods with new ones, investment and consumption growth will be promoted, thereby promoting economic recovery. At the same time, the resilience of external demand in the second quarter will still stimulate the recovery of domestic manufacturing production capacity. It is expected that the GDP growth rate in the second quarter will rebound significantly from the first quarter, reaching around 5.5% year-on-year. The GDP growth rate in the first half of the year was recorded at 5.0%.",,,,
"The global economy faces many challenges in 2023: geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have pushed up energy prices, and imported inflation has sharply increased residents\' living and corporate production costs; many central banks around the world have begun an interest rate hike cycle, and interest rates have risen. Suppressing physical demand while increasing fiscal refinancing costs; the outbreak of banking crises in Europe and the United States has increased the cost and difficulty for residents and enterprises to obtain credit resources. Benefiting from the restoration of supply chains after the epidemic, global inflation is cooling down in an orderly manner; although economic growth has slowed down, it remains resilient.",,,,
"U.S. economic growth will weaken in 2024: (1) Consumption resilience has declined: residents’ excess savings are expected to be exhausted by the end of 2023; the window period for rapid inflation decline has passed, and residents’ actual wage growth has peaked and declined. (2) Corporate investment willingness is suppressed: Corporate debts will mature in a concentrated manner from 2023 to 2025. Under high interest rates, the corporate sector is about to face higher debt replacement costs, and there is insufficient willingness to increase leverage. (3) The two parties in Congress have still not reached agreement on the budget for the new fiscal year; a prerequisite for the passage of the previous debt ceiling bill was to reduce fiscal expenditures in 2024-2025.",,,,
"In 2024, Japan\'s economic structure will see a pattern of """"recovering domestic demand and weakening external demand"""": (1) Resident consumption is highly resilient. It is expected that after the new round of labor negotiations, the real salary income growth rate of Japanese residents will turn positive. Taking into account the wealth effect and high consumption tendency, Japanese residents have sufficient consumption potential. (2) Corporate profits gradually improved. In 2023, Japan\'s trade deficit will continue to narrow, the PPI-CPI scissor gap will converge significantly, and corporate profits will significantly improve, which will have a better stimulating effect on corporate investment. (3) There are big challenges in exporting. Most central banks around the world are nearing the end of their interest rate hikes. The Japanese yen exchange rate will enter an appreciation cycle in 2024, and product competitiveness will decline. There is a higher possibility of weakening economic growth in Europe and the United States in 2024, and insufficient external demand will further weigh on exports.",,,,
"The risk of economic recession in the Eurozone is rising in 2024: (1) The positive contribution of inflation cooling and supply chain repair to the economy is coming to an end. As inflation stabilizes and supply chain repairs are completed, the inhibitory effect of high interest rates on the economy will be significantly strengthened. (2) Rising interest rates and tightening financing conditions will inhibit residents and corporate borrowing. The survey showed both the share of respondents who expect mortgage rates to continue to rise and who expect it to become more difficult to obtain credit remain high. (3) The weakening of the global economy in 2024 will further suppress demand for Eurozone goods, and Eurozone exports are expected to remain sluggish in 2024. (4) Fiscal support for the economy has weakened. The ECB predicts that the scale of energy-related subsidies in EU countries will further reduce in 2024 and will withdraw from this subsidy policy in 2025.",,,,

"In February 2024, the official manufacturing PMI was 49.1%, which was expected to be 49.2%, and the previous value was 49.2%; the official non-manufacturing PMI was 51.4%, which was expected to be 50.7%, and the previous value was 50.7%.",,,,
"February PMI impression: The supply and demand structure of the manufacturing industry has improved, the construction industry continues to be under pressure, and the service industry has improved at the margin. (1) The manufacturing PMI is better than the seasonality month-on-month. Both supply and demand are declining, but the supply and demand structure has improved in the short term. The manufacturing PMI in February was 49.1%, which was lower than the Spring Festival average of 50.0% in the past five years. The good thing is that it was only down 0.1 percentage point compared with January, which was better than the -0.3% Spring Festival average in the past five years. Under the Spring Festival effect, the contraction of supply is greater than that of demand, resulting in short-term improvements in the supply and demand pattern and price levels.",,,,
"(2) The PMI of the construction industry has declined for 2 consecutive months. The sample number of construction sites in the Centennial Construction Survey in 2024 is 10,094, which is lower than the 12,220 sites in 2023. It is pointed out that """"the total number of new projects has decreased and the start of construction progress is slower than last year (2023), and the construction of specific continuation projects in some areas has been suspended."""" Looking forward, trillions of treasury bonds will gradually form a physical workload, superimposed on real estate to speed up whitelist financing approvals and special loans for urban reform, and the construction industry\'s prosperity may stabilize.",,,,
"(3) Marginal improvement in service industry PMI. The consistency of the Spring Festival consumption data lies in the fact that """"volume"""" exceeds expectations and """"price"""" is relatively stable, but the recovery path of the overall consumption level remains resilient. In terms of industries, air transportation, monetary and financial services, culture, sports and entertainment and other industries were relatively prosperous in February; the business activity index of real estate, resident services and other industries continued to be below the critical point.",,,,
Reminder that the progress of resumption of work and production may be slowed down,,,,
"Judging from the two indicators, the drop in supply may be more than seasonal, and the slope of resumption of work and production has changed to a certain extent. (1) Baidu Map Migration Index dropped significantly: in the week of the Spring Festival, 1 week after the holiday, and 2 weeks after the holiday, the resumption progress in 2024 was 48.2%, 76.5%, and 96.2% respectively, which were +3.0% and -1.4 respectively compared with the same period in 2023. %, -2.2%.

"(2) Centenary Construction\'s resumption rate: As of February 27 (the eighteenth day of the first lunar month), Centenary Construction\'s survey of 10,094 construction sites across the country had a resumption rate of 39.9%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points year-on-year in the lunar calendar; the labor employment rate was 38.1%, a year-on-year increase in the lunar calendar dropped by 5.2 percentage points.",,,,
Supply and demand rebalancing perspective: further confirmation of “walking on two legs”,,,,
"In 2023, we have repeatedly emphasized """"walking on two legs"""", that is, simply developing advanced manufacturing may cause overcapacity. In addition to infrastructure + the old driving forces of the three major projects, fiscal investment may also consider the residential sector, including fiscal expenditures to increase wages. , central consumer vouchers and consumption subsidies, central financial subsidies to residents (Europe, the United States and Japan), income distribution system reform, etc. On February 23, General Secretary Xi Jinping presided over the fourth meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, emphasizing “promoting a new round of large-scale equipment updates and the replacement of old consumer goods with new ones”, and pointed out that “the linkage between central finance and local governments must be adhered to”, pointing to greater emphasis on policy thinking.

Guide the orderly adjustment and optimization of the steel, coking, electrolytic aluminum and other industries in key areas.",,,,
"(6) Comprehensively carry out the upgrading and transformation of traditional industrial clusters. Cities where small and medium-sized traditional manufacturing companies are concentrated must formulate development plans for gas-related industry clusters, strictly implement project approvals, and strictly prevent pollution from going to the countryside. We will formulate special rectification plans for existing industrial clusters, eliminate and close down some, move some into parks, renovate some on-site, and make some better and stronger in accordance with the law. All localities should combine the characteristics of industrial clusters and build centralized heating centers, centralized spraying centers, centralized organic solvent recovery and disposal centers, and centralized activated carbon regeneration centers according to local conditions.",,,,
"(7) Optimize the structure of raw and auxiliary materials and products containing VOCs. Strictly control the production and use of high-VOCs content coatings, inks, adhesives, cleaning agents and other construction projects, and increase the proportion of low (no) VOCs-content products. Implement the source substitution project and increase the substitution of raw and auxiliary materials with low (no) VOCs content in the industrial coating, packaging, printing and electronics industries.

"3. Optimize the energy structure and accelerate the development of clean, low-carbon and efficient energy",,,,
"(9) Vigorously develop new energy and clean energy. By 2025, the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption will reach about 20%, and electric energy will account for about 30% of final energy consumption. Continue to increase the production and supply of natural gas, and give priority to new natural gas to ensure residents\' living and clean heating needs.",,,,
"(10) Strictly and rationally control total coal consumption. On the premise of ensuring safe energy supply, total coal consumption control will continue to be implemented in key areas. By 2025, coal consumption in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas and the Yangtze River Delta region will decrease by about 10% and 5% respectively compared with 2020. Coal consumption in the Fenwei Plain will achieve negative growth, with a focus on reducing non-power coal use. For new reconstruction and expansion coal-using projects in key areas, the equivalent or reduced amount of coal shall be substituted in accordance with the law. If the substitution plan is incomplete, it will not be approved; the use of highly polluting fuels such as petroleum coke, coke, blue charcoal, etc. shall not be used as an alternative measure for coal reduction. Improve the alternative management methods for coal consumption reduction in key areas. Coal gangue and coal used as raw materials will not be included in the assessment of total coal consumption. In principle, no new self-provided coal-fired units will be added, and self-provided coal-fired units will be supported in their implementation of clean energy substitution. Coal power projects and their coal consumption that support stable power supply, safe operation of the power grid, and large-scale grid connection and consumption of clean energy should be reasonably guaranteed.",,,,
"(11) Actively carry out the shutdown and integration of coal-fired boilers. All localities should incorporate coal-fired heating boiler replacement projects into urban heating planning. In principle, coal-fired boilers with a capacity of 35 tons/hour or less will no longer be built in built-up areas of cities at the county level and above, and coal-fired boilers other than central heating will no longer be built in key areas. Accelerate the construction of thermal pipeline networks, rely on power plants and large industrial enterprises to carry out long-distance heating demonstrations, and eliminate coal-fired boilers and scattered coal within the coverage of the pipeline network. By 2025, cities that do not meet PM2.5 standards will basically phase out coal-fired boilers with a capacity of 10 tons/hour and below; key areas will basically phase out coal-fired boilers with a capacity of 35 tons/hour and below, as well as tea boilers, commercial stoves, and grain storage and drying equipment. , agricultural product processing and other coal-fired facilities, give full play to the heating capacity of combined heat and power plants of 300,000 kilowatts and above, and provide coal-fired boilers and backward coal-fired small thermal power units (including self-owned power plants) within a 30-kilometer heating radius. Perform shutdown or consolidation.",,,,
"(12) Implement clean energy substitution in industrial furnaces. Promote the replacement of coal with electricity in an orderly manner, and actively and steadily promote the replacement of coal with gas. No new fuel gas generators will be added in key areas. Newly renovated and expanded heating furnaces, heat treatment furnaces, drying furnaces, and melting furnaces will in principle use clean and low-carbon energy. Industrial furnaces that use highly polluting fuels will be safely and securely promoted to use industrial waste heat, Electric energy, natural gas, etc.; fuel gasifiers should be replaced by clean energy, or centralized gas supply and decentralized use in parks (clusters) should be adopted according to local conditions; fixed-bed intermittent gasifiers should be phased out gradually.",,,,
"(13) Continue to promote clean heating in the northern region. Clean heating in northern areas will be promoted in an area based on local conditions to ensure that people stay warm during the winter. We will increase efforts to replace loose coal for civilian and agricultural use, basically eliminate loose coal in plain areas in key areas, and gradually promote the replacement of loose coal with clean energy in mountainous areas. Cities included in the scope of central fiscal support for clean heating in the northern region must complete the transformation tasks with quality and quantity. Among them, """"coal-to-gas"""" must implement gas sources for customized modifications. Comprehensively improve building energy efficiency and accelerate energy-saving renovation of existing farm buildings. In accordance with the law, various localities have designated areas that have completed clean heating transformation as high-pollution fuel burning no-burn zones to prevent the re-burning of loose coal. For areas where clean heating has not yet been implemented, supervision of commercial coal quality will be strengthened.",,,,
4. Optimize the transportation structure and vigorously develop a green transportation system,,,,
"(14) Continue to optimize and adjust the cargo transportation structure. For medium and long-distance bulk cargo transportation, priority is given to railways and waterways, while for short-distance transportation, closed belt corridors or new energy vehicles and ships are preferred. Explore the use of clean transportation as the focus of review and supervision of new reconstruction and expansion projects in coal mines, steel, thermal power, non-ferrous metals, coking, coal chemicals and other industries. Municipalities and provincial capital cities in key areas adopt """"outside integration and internal distribution"""" logistics methods such as road-rail combined transportation. By 2025, railway and waterway freight volumes will increase by about 10% and 12% respectively compared with 2020; among the medium and long-distance transportation (transportation distance of more than 500 kilometers) of coal and coke in the new main coal-producing areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia, the proportion of railway transportation will be strived to Reach 90%; the proportion of clean transportation (including new energy vehicles) of iron ore, coke, etc. (including new energy vehicles) in key areas and major coastal ports in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area will strive to reach 80%.",,,,
"Strengthen the construction of dedicated railway lines and intermodal transportation connection facilities to maximize the efficiency of existing lines. When building new container and bulk dry bulk cargo operating areas in important port areas, in principle, they will simultaneously plan and build inbound railways; expand rail transportation in existing operating areas ability. Cargo-friendly transformation of urban railway stations in key areas. Newly built and relocated logistics parks, industrial and mining enterprises and coal storage bases with an annual bulk cargo volume of more than 1.5 million tons will in principle be connected to special railway lines or pipelines. Strengthen measures to ensure land use and sea use, acceptance and commissioning, transportation capacity deployment, railway freight rates and other measures.",,,,
"(15) Accelerate the improvement of the cleanliness level of motor vehicles. New energy vehicles will account for no less than 80% of new or updated buses, rentals, urban logistics distribution, light sanitation and other vehicles in public areas in key areas; the elimination of gas trucks using lean combustion technology will be accelerated. Promote Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Shaanxi Province to create leading areas for clean transportation and cultivate a number of clean transportation enterprises. Promote new energy medium and heavy-duty trucks in thermal power, steel, coal, coking, non-ferrous metals, cement and other industries and logistics parks, and develop zero-emission freight fleets. We strive to achieve a coverage rate of no less than 80% of fast charging stations in key areas and no less than 60% in other areas by 2025.",,,,
"Strengthen supervision and random inspections of newly produced trucks to achieve full coverage of the entire family. Strengthen road inspections and home inspections of heavy trucks. Comprehensively implement the automobile emission inspection and maintenance system and the motor vehicle emission recall system, and strengthen the supervision and law enforcement of annual inspection agencies. Encourage key regional cities to carry out fuel evaporative emission control testing.",,,,
"(16) Strengthen the comprehensive management of non-road mobile sources. Accelerate the renewal and transformation of new energy sources for internal operating vehicles and machinery in railway freight yards, logistics parks, ports, airports, and industrial and mining enterprises. Promote the development of new energy and clean energy ships and increase the utilization rate of shore power.

"Important data: China\'s social financing scale increased by 2,069.2 billion yuan in May, an increase of 513.2 billion yuan from the same period last year. RMB loans increased by RMB 815.7 billion, a decrease of RMB 406.2 billion from the same period last year. The stock of social financing increased by 8.4% year-on-year, 0.1 percentage point higher than the previous value.",,,,
"The year-on-year increase in social financing in May was mainly due to the contribution of government special bonds and corporate bond financing, while new RMB loans decreased year-on-year. In May, new government special bonds increased by 438.3 billion yuan, a month-on-month increase of 396%, and a year-on-year increase of 59%. The issuance of special bonds has accelerated, and policies and projects have been stepped up. In terms of policy, the Politburo meeting at the end of the month proposed """"accelerating the issuance and use of special bonds."""" In terms of projects, on April 23, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance completed the screening of local government special bond projects in 2024, and a total of about 38,000 special bond projects were screened and approved. .",,,,
"RMB loans decreased by 410 billion yuan compared with the same period last year. In terms of items, household loans decreased by 291.5 billion yuan year-on-year, and short-term and medium-term and long-term loans decreased by 174.5 and 117 billion yuan respectively. Although real estate policies continue to be tightened, the sales of second-hand houses are obviously better than that of new houses, and the sales of new houses are an indicator of leading investment and long-term loans for residents. Pay attention to the impact of the tightening of policies on the sale of new houses. Corporate loans decreased by 115.8 billion yuan year-on-year, mainly due to the surge in bill financing. Bill financing increased significantly by 315.2 billion yuan year-on-year, while short-term and medium-term and long-term loans decreased by 155.0 billion yuan and 269.8 billion yuan year-on-year respectively. In addition, RMB loans are weak, and strict regulation of """"manual interest supplement"""" in policies has a certain impact. The impact of """"squeezing out water"""" is long-term.

"M1 -4.2% year-on-year, continuous negative growth. Recently, the central media issued an article """"How to understand the changes in M1 growth rate?"""" """", the article believes that in the first half of the year, under the combined influence of factors such as """"squeezing water"""" from the financial industry and slow fiscal efforts, the growth rate of M1 declined. From a deeper level, the statistical caliber of M1 does not include residents\' current deposits, making M1 less important to enterprises. Current deposits are particularly sensitive to changes. That is, the lack of residents\' demand deposits is one of the factors causing the sharp fluctuations in M1. In the future, the central bank may change the statistical caliber of M1 and pay more attention to the residents.",,,,
Watch next week: China’s economic data for May (Monday),,,,
"On September 24, Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People\'s Bank of China, announced a """"package of policies"""" at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office. First, the deposit reserve ratio and policy interest rate will be lowered. In the near future, the deposit reserve ratio will be lowered by 0.5 percentage points, providing about 1 trillion yuan of long-term liquidity to the financial market; the central bank\'s policy interest rate will be lowered, that is, the 7-day reverse repurchase operation rate will be lowered by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5%, and at the same time, the loan market quotation rate and deposit rate will be guided to decline simultaneously to maintain the stability of the net interest margin of commercial banks. Second, the interest rate of existing mortgage loans will be lowered and the minimum down payment ratio of mortgage loans will be unified. Guide commercial banks to reduce the interest rate of existing mortgage loans to the vicinity of the interest rate of newly issued loans, with an average reduction of about 0.5 percentage points; unify the minimum down payment ratio of mortgage loans for the first and second homes, and reduce the latter from the current 25% to 15%. Third, create two new monetary policy tools. Create two monetary policy tools, namely, the securities, funds, and insurance company swap facility and the special re-loan for stock repurchase and increase, to support the stable development of the stock market. Our comments on this are as follows:",,,,
"1. The economy is under downward pressure, so it is necessary to cut interest rates. The Fed’s interest rate cut also opens up space for this operation.",,,,
"Judging from recent economic data, the macroeconomic data in August weakened marginally compared with July, and the drag of weak demand on production continued to show, and the drag increased. From the demand side, the growth rate of infrastructure construction investment declined marginally. In August, infrastructure investment (excluding electricity) increased by 4.4% year-on-year, 0.5 percentage points lower than the previous value; the decline in real estate development investment has not narrowed, and the cumulative year-on-year decline in real estate development investment in August was 10.2%, and the deep adjustment of the real estate market continued; the growth rate of fixed investment in the tertiary industry was negative for three consecutive months, and the decline widened; the growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods failed to continue the improvement trend in July, and the year-on-year growth rate of commodity retail sales fell below 2% again. From the supply side, the industrial added value in August fell by 0.6 percentage points from July, and the drag of terminal consumption on the production side may be increasing; against this background, the pressure of """"maintaining the five"""" in the fourth quarter is relatively large. From the price level, the year-on-year decline of PPI in August widened, expanding by 1 percentage point from the previous value to -1.8%, and the year-on-year growth rate of CPI rebounded by 0.1 percentage point from the previous value to 0.6%, which is still at a historically low level, and the price level continues to be low. Under the background of economic recovery under pressure, supportive monetary policy still needs to continue to exert its strength to provide a suitable financial environment for the recovery of the real economy. At this time, it is necessary to cut the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates. In addition, since August,",,,,
China’s Balance of Payments Report 2023,,,,
"In December, the number of new non-farm jobs in the United States was 217,000 (market expected 170,000), the unemployment rate was 3.7% (market expected 3.8%), the labor participation rate was 62.5% (market expected 62.8%), and the average hourly wage increased by 4.1% year-on-year ( The market expected 3.9%), and the month-on-month growth rate was 0.4% (the market expected 0.3%). The overshooting of the labor force participation rate of the working-age population has been restored, coupled with the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic. The labor force participation rate has fallen sharply, and the process of """"balancing supply and demand"""" in the labor market has been hindered. Under the influence of another contraction in labor supply, the unemployment rate has remained low, nominal wages have maintained high growth, and new employment has become quite resilient, which may support the stickiness of inflation. Looking forward, the de-inflation process may slow down significantly, and the Fed\'s dovish turn is likely to be less than market expectations.",,,,
"Commodity futures: Overall neutral, pay attention to the continuity of adjustments;",,,,
Stock index futures: buy hedging.,,,,
"Commodities adjusted overall, pay attention to liquidity indicators. Commodities adjusted overall on Monday, and stock indexes in Japan, South Korea, India, the European Union and other countries also adjusted rapidly, and the Japanese and Korean indices hit the circuit breaker. The reason for the analysis is firstly that the US manufacturing PMI in July and the non-farm data in July were lower than expected, but it is still too early to talk about a US recession, and gold also recorded adjustments under the recession scenario; therefore, more shocks come from the liquidity level, and the carry trade liquidation caused by the continued appreciation of the yen. At present, the liquidity observation indicators such as 3M US Treasury bonds, LIBOR-OIS, and SOFR interest rates have even deteriorated to cash preference scenarios such as US dollar reflexivity. The decline did not continue after Tuesday, and the stock indexes of some countries rebounded significantly, so pay attention to sustainability.",,,,
"The domestic economy still needs to bottom out. From the macro fundamentals, the manufacturing PMI in July slightly exceeded expectations; the financial data in June was neutral, and the government\'s new bonds fell slightly month-on-month; China\'s exports remained strong in July, among which the exports of electronic products, automobiles, furniture and home appliances, textiles and clothing, machinery and equipment industries remained strong. The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting on July 30 to analyze and study the current economic situation and deploy economic work in the second half of the year. Compared with April, this meeting was more cautious about the external environment and paid more attention to domestic demand. The judgment of the external environment at this meeting was further expressed from """"complexity, severity, and uncertainty"""" in April to """"increasing adverse effects"""", corresponding to the United States in May and the European Union in June successively imposing tariffs on some of my country\'s export goods. When talking about the domestic economy, it was frank that """"economic operation has diverged"""" and """"there are pains in the transformation of new and old kinetic energy"""", not just the challenges in the process of """"the economy continues to recover and improve"""" in April. The meeting slightly boosted domestic economic expectations.

"Since 2024, with the steady recovery of industrial demand and the continued efforts to stabilize growth policies, industrial output has grown steadily. On the demand side, despite the intensive introduction of policies to stabilize growth, improved domestic and international environments, and higher-than-expected growth in external demand, the current endogenous growth momentum is insufficient, investment growth is greatly affected by policies, and the overall stabilization of the domestic economy still needs to be further restored.",,,,

Core point of view: The clarion call for “recovery” has sounded,,,,
"Highlight 1: External demand is stronger than domestic demand. High-frequency data since May point to further improvement in external demand, and the """"strongness"""" of exports will continue. In April, export growth picked up significantly, outperforming domestic demand; in May, high-frequency indicators such as the CCFI composite index expanded their gains, pointing to the continuation of strong export performance. Driven by exports, manufacturing production has strengthened significantly; in particular, industries with greater export improvements such as automobiles and transportation equipment have seen higher marginal increases in added value.",,,,
"Highlight 2: The recovery slope of domestic demand is upward, """"equipment updates"""" have driven investment demand to heat up, and the effect of policy implementation will be further revealed. Since February, investment in equipment and tools has maintained a high growth rate of more than 17%, significantly higher than the 6.6% at the end of last year. In terms of industries, traditional industries are one of the key areas supported by this round of policies, and their investment demand has expanded more significantly. In April, the investment growth rate of the mining industry expanded to 21.3%, a significant increase of 19.2 percentage points from the end of last year.",,,,
"Highlight 3: The early real estate-related support policies have also achieved certain results. In April, new real estate projects started and the growth rate of construction area continued to improve. Since the beginning of the year, in order to solve the problem of real estate financing, local real estate financing coordination mechanisms have been continuously implemented; as of the end of March, commercial banks have completed the review of the first batch of """"white list"""" projects. With policy support, the cumulative number of new real estate construction starts and construction area in April rebounded 3.2 and 0.3 percentage points year-on-year to -24.6% and -10.8% respectively from the previous month.",,,,

Looking at the two-year composite view, this year\'s Tomb Sweeping Day holiday has more days and more people travel, driving the growth rate of catering revenue to increase by 6.3 percentage points to 22.5%; the growth rate of commodity retail sales increased by 2.9 percentage points to 8.7%, among which the consumption of automobiles and communication equipment performed well Eye.",,,,
"The slow progress of special bond issuance has already shown its drag on infrastructure investment, and this constraint may improve in the future as the pace of issuance accelerates.

Affected by this, the growth rate of infrastructure investment in April fell by 1 percentage point to 7.8%.

The rebound in demand for replenishment in the United States has directly boosted my country\'s exports on the one hand; on the other hand, it has boosted manufacturing production in emerging markets and indirectly supported my country\'s exports of resource products and other products.

First, from the perspective of crude oil supply, the main impact of this geopolitical incident on the crude oil end is concentrated on the crude oil supply end and transportation end. When the oil-producing countries and transportation channels in the region are not significantly affected, the impact of the conflict on oil prices will not be obvious. Mainly short-term pulse effects. At present, core oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Egypt, as well as important crude oil transportation routes such as the Suez Strait and the Strait of Hormuz, have not been substantially involved in the conflict and have not been significantly affected. However, at the same time, there is still great uncertainty in the follow-up trend of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The recent public protests against Israel by Iran and other countries, and the tightening of oil sanctions on Iran by the United States are still unfolding. The subsequent impact on oil-producing countries such as Iran remains to be seen. observe. Second, from the perspective of the term structure of crude oil, oil prices have gradually emerged from the deep far-month discount structure in the early stage. Since the end of October, the discount range of WTI\'s two consecutive contracts compared to the main contract has continued to shrink, indicating that the previous rise in geopolitical risks has caused The oil price bubble is gradually fading, and crude oil prices have returned to fundamental logic. On the other hand, pessimism about the demand side has accelerated the recent decline in oil prices. On the one hand, economic data such as the Eurozone PMI have been weak and have been below the boom-bust line for 16 consecutive months, triggering market concerns that its economic recession may drag down crude oil demand. Second, the recent November report released by the EIA shows that the EIA has reversed its judgment on the recent supply and demand of crude oil. It has adjusted its forecast in October from """"crude oil will be short of 160,000 barrels/day in the second half of the year"""" to """"there will be a surplus of 60,000 barrels/day in the second half of the year."""" """", and it is expected that the supply and demand easing will continue from the fourth quarter of this year to the end of next year. Overall, we believe that although oil prices fell below US$80/barrel this week, there is still strong support at both the supply and demand ends of crude oil at US$80/barrel: According to the latest fiscal break-even oil prices of oil-producing countries released by the IMF, The breakeven oil prices of Saudi Arabia and other countries are above US$80/barrel, which means that when oil prices are about to fall below US$80/barrel, these countries have strong incentives to reduce supply through voluntary cuts. At the same time, on the demand side, the U.S.’s latest planned oil purchase price limit is US$79/barrel, which means that when the oil price falls below US$80/barrel, the United States has a strong willingness to carry out strategic replenishment of crude oil stocks. Looking ahead to the market outlook, we believe that the recent drop in oil prices to below US$80/barrel is mainly due to short-term sentiment. After sentiment recovers, oil prices will have strong momentum to return to above US$80/barrel. At the same time, the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict has not yet affected crude oil production and transportation. Unless subsequent conflicts further affect oil-producing countries such as Iran, the impact of this round of geopolitical conflicts on oil prices may have come to an end, and the impact on U.S. inflation will also weaken.",,,,
"The housing item still provides some support to core CPI. The main contribution to core inflation this time was the housing item. In October, the owner\'s equivalent rent increased by 0.4% month-on-month, which was lower than the previous value of 0.6%. The rent of the main residence increased by 0.5% month-on-month, which was the same as the previous value. Looking forward, we believe that owner-equivalent rents and primary residence rents will further slow down. Currently, house prices and rent indices (Corelogic, Zillow, etc.) in the U.S. market have fallen continuously, indicating that U.S. housing inflation may return to a downward path.",,,,
"Commodity items in core CPI continued to decline. Commodity items fell by 0.1% month-on-month in October, lower than the previous value of 0.4%, with second-hand car prices still the main drag.

Looking forward to the market outlook, the Manheim used car wholesale price index and the Blackbook used car price index, the leading indicators of used cars, remain low. It is expected that used car prices will continue to decline further.",,,,
"What impact does this inflation data have on the Fed’s decision-making? At present, the focus of the Federal Reserve\'s policy is still on controlling inflation. This CPI data shows that the Federal Reserve has achieved certain results in the fight against inflation, and the signals of economic cooling are gradually increasing. The October PMI has emerged, and the driving force of inflation has shifted from the supply side in the past. Switching to the demand side further reduces the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Looking forward, whether to raise interest rates again depends on whether the slowdown is sustained. The Fed needs to see more data to support the continued softening of employment + inflation, not an accidental data accident. At the same time, taking into account that in order to prevent financial conditions from relaxing too quickly, the Fed\'s recent strategy may still be to continue to """"raise interest rates with words"""", that is, while not raising interest rates, it uses various hawkish remarks to manage market expectations. According to the CME Observation Tool, after the release of this data, the market tends to expect that the Fed\'s interest rate hikes are almost over, and the first interest rate cut will be in June next year, and interest rates will remain high for longer, which is still the current baseline scenario.",,,,
"The overall market reaction was that stocks rose, bonds fell, and the dollar fell. This data is a key data point for predicting future Fed interest rate trends. The actual data released exceeded expectations and cooled down, boosting market sentiment. After the data was released, as of the close on November 14, U.S. bond yields fell rapidly. The 10-year U.S. bond fell 19 BP to 4.44%, the 2-year U.S. bond fell 22 BP to 4.80%, the U.S. dollar index fell 1.51% to 104.08, and the three major U.S. stock indexes The Nasdaq, Dow, and S&P 500 rose 2.37%, 1.43%, and 1.91% respectively.",,,,

"U.S. Treasuries will remain high and fluctuate in the short term, and the center of U.S. bond oscillations may decline. However, the Fed has not yet reached the stage of policy transition. The decline will be affected by the Fed\'s tightening of financial condition targets and market concerns about insufficient demand for U.S. Treasury bonds. Or it may be limited, and it has not yet entered a trend downward channel. The bond market\'s reaction to recent market conditions may be relatively complex. At present, the Fed\'s policy has not yet changed, and hawkish statements may continue. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department\'s 30-year Treasury bond auction points to the market\'s continued concerns about excessive supply and insufficient demand for U.S. debt, and Moody\'s lowered the outlook for the U.S. credit rating to negative. The incident may intensify the market\'s concerns about the expansionary fiscal policy of the United States and the possible slowdown in U.S. economic growth due to restrictions on future fiscal spending. The short-term U.S. debt shock center may be expected to continue to decline, but the extent of the decline may be limited. The U.S. debt will truly enter a downward trend channel, but the next performance of the U.S. economy will have to wait. If the economy shows a sharp downturn, it may be the time when the U.S. debt trend turns.",,,,
"The convergence of interest rates between China and the United States and the shift in overseas liquidity are good for Hong Kong stocks. In the short term, it is recommended to focus on the growth style of Hong Kong stocks. In terms of indexes, focus on the Hang Seng Technology Index. In terms of sectors, focus on sectors where Hong Kong stocks are sensitive to the contraction of interest rates between China and the United States, such as pharmaceuticals, automobiles, semiconductors, etc. . In terms of U.S. stocks, taking into account earnings revisions and recent weakness in macro data, we believe that the recent rebound in U.S. stocks is more a result of the decline in U.S. bond yields. In the short term, as risk appetite increases and the U.S. economy still has some resilience, U.S. stock earnings still have some support, funds are expected to further flow into U.S. stocks. However, at the same time, the high valuation of U.S. stocks since the beginning of this year still needs to be further digested, and the subsequent U.S. economic downturn Risks cannot be ignored. Signs of weakness in October PMI data have emerged, and subsequent adjustments in the stock market are inevitable. In terms of Hong Kong stocks, the current valuation of Hong Kong stocks is still at the historical bottom area. Overseas liquidity has become looser, Sino-US relations have accelerated and eased, and domestic fundamentals have gradually recovered, which has increased the motivation for funds to add positions in Hong Kong stocks. Funds are expected to return to Hong Kong stocks, superimposing the impact of Hong Kong stocks on China and the United States. The interest rate differential is more sensitive to the shift, and Hong Kong stocks are currently in the allocation window. In terms of allocation, the growth style represented by the Hang Seng Technology Index may be dominant in the near future. In the short term, it is recommended to pay attention to the Hang Seng Technology Index and sectors that are sensitive to the contraction of Sino-US interest rates, such as medicine, automobiles, semiconductors, etc.",,,,
"The US dollar has intensified its oscillations, and the center of the oscillation may move downwards. The pressure on the RMB has improved, and it is expected to fluctuate in both directions in the range of 7.2-7.4 in the short term. The U.S. dollar\'s volatile rise this year is mainly affected by two aspects: on the one hand, in the United States, the U.S. economy has performed better than expected, U.S. bond yields have risen rapidly in the third quarter, and the expectations of the Federal Reserve\'s interest rate hikes have repeatedly fluctuated, etc., all of which have affected interest rate spreads; on the other hand, Fundamentals and policy changes outside the United States also affect changes in interest rate spreads. Since the second half of this year, the Eurozone economic expectations have weakened, especially the German economy, which is expected to shrink further. Interest rate differences between the United States and Germany have gradually widened, and the euro has been under pressure against the US dollar. On the other hand, the Bank of Japan fine-tuned the YCC policy, which was lower than market expectations, which also triggered further strength of the US dollar against the yen. In the short term, the U.S. dollar index still has some support under the influence of the Federal Reserve\'s suspension of interest rate hikes and the continued weakness of the Eurozone economy. However, at the same time, the market currently tends to trade the end of the interest rate hike cycle and the slowdown in U.S. economic momentum. , both aspects have increased downward pressure on the US dollar. In the short term, it is expected that the US dollar will intensify its volatility, and the center of the US dollar may move downward. In terms of the RMB, domestic positive factors continue to accumulate. The central financial work conference was held, the trillions of special government bonds were issued, and policies were introduced intensively. Sino-US relations further eased, and the domestic economy maintained a stable and improving recovery trend. At the same time, the central bank and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange launched the Exchange rate stabilization tools ensure that the exchange rate operates stably within a reasonable range, and support for the RMB may gradually increase. However, at the same time, domestic and foreign monetary policies remain divergent and other factors still put pressure on the trend of the RMB.

"The overall price improvement trend slowed down in October. CPI was mainly affected by the good weather, sufficient supply of agricultural products and falling demand after the holidays. PPI was mainly affected by fluctuations in crude oil and non-ferrous metal prices and the higher base number in the same period last year. Prices fell seasonally in October, but the magnitude was relatively large. Combined with the manufacturing PMI returning to the prosperous line that month, the recovery slope of total demand was slow. Judging from high-frequency data, the prices of agricultural products and crude oil have continued to fall recently, putting greater pressure on price trends. The hedging effect of a lower base may be limited, and prices are expected to remain weak in November. For industrial enterprises, the narrowing trend of the PPI-CPI scissor gap has slowed down, the price side's role in promoting operational improvement has weakened, and the recovery of total demand has become the main influencing variable.",,,,

However, the month-on-month growth rate is lower than the average in recent years, reflecting that the recovery of total demand is still not strong. From the perspective of food items, falling food prices are the main factor behind the weakening of CPI month-on-month and year-on-year. In terms of non-food items, gasoline increased slightly month-on-month and travel prices fell.

"Looking forward to the market outlook, let’s look at the key factors affecting commodity trends in the near future: 1) U.S. bond interest rates. At present, the U.S. economy is still very resilient, the job market is still tight, inflation still has upward risks, and the probability of raising interest rates again within the year still exists, which means that U.S. bond interest rates are at risk of rising in stages and suppressing market risk appetite; 2) Domestic economy. With the support of a series of policies to stabilize growth, a number of data show that the domestic economy has shown signs of stabilization and improvement, but the extent of improvement is still relatively limited. In particular, there is still great uncertainty in the improvement of the real estate sector, and """"weak reality"""" Risks remain. 3) Geopolitical factors. The sudden outbreak of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke the short-lived calm in the Middle East. The current direct impact on commodities is relatively limited. However, if the scale of the conflict expands in the future (or even evolves into the sixth Middle East war), then the international oil market will bear the brunt of the impact.

"Energy and commodity prices continued to weaken, driving the August CPI data downward, but core services continued to rebound, indicating that the endogenous demand of the US economy is not weak: the US CPI in August weakened significantly from the previous value (2.9%→2.5%), reflecting a marginal weakening of inflationary pressure, but it was mainly driven by energy and commodities. The core CPI was flat month-on-month and slightly higher than expected year-on-year, reflecting that domestic demand is still strong, and the easing of financial conditions since May is gradually being transmitted to the economy. Looking at the main sub-items, the food item weakened marginally month-on-month (0.2%→0.1%), and the energy item turned sharply negative again month-on-month (0%→-0.8%). This was mainly due to the obvious decline in international oil prices under the dual influence of the Trump deal and the US economic recession deal since July, which was also an important reason for the sharp decline in inflation in August; the decline in core commodities narrowed slightly (-0.3%→-0.2%), among which the decline in transportation products (new and used cars) narrowed (-0.8%→-0.3%). The deflationary pressure on the commodity side is weakening marginally, but it still constitutes the second largest driver of inflation after energy; core services have rebounded for two consecutive months (0.3%→0.4%), indicating that the service item is still the last bastion of US inflation resilience, among which the housing rental item rebounded again month-on-month (0.4%→0.5%), which is consistent with the recent stabilization and recovery of the US real estate market.",,,,

However, from the perspective of the structure of inflation, energy and commodities are the main contributors. Core inflation, especially in the service industry, is not weak, reflecting that the resilience of the US economy is still strong. Since May, the US Treasury bond interest rate has fallen sharply and the US financial conditions have been relaxed, which has been initially reflected in the economic data in August. At present, the US economy presents a """"Goldilocks"""" pattern, that is, the inflation pressure is marginally weakened and the economy is relatively resilient. The US economic recession that the market had previously traded may gradually subside. For the Fed, a 25BP rate cut in September and a 50-75BP rate cut for the whole year may be a neutral judgment. On the one hand, the downside risks of the US economy are still relatively controllable. On the other hand, excessive rate cuts are likely to trigger secondary inflation risks. For major asset classes, in the context of relatively full expectations of interest rate cuts already factored in, U.S. Treasury bond yields may fluctuate in the short term, while U.S. stocks are in the stage of digesting relatively high valuations in the short term.

"The Ministry of Justice recently issued a notice arranging to carry out a nationwide campaign to “reduce and speed up notarization for the convenience of the public” from now until the end of this year. On March 21, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Justice answered reporters’ questions on issues related to the activities.",,,,
"Question: Why did the Ministry of Justice plan to carry out this activity of “notarization, reduction of certification, convenience for the people, and speeding up”?",,,,
"Answer: Notary services are an important part of public legal services and are closely related to the production and life of the broad masses of the people. Over the years, the Ministry of Justice has always adhered to the people-centered development idea, conscientiously implemented the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on benefiting enterprises and convenience people, and regarded providing high-quality, efficient and convenient notarial legal services to the people as the starting point and goal of its work. A series of effective measures have been adopted to promote notarization and certification reduction to facilitate the people and achieve good results, playing an important role in optimizing the business environment, promoting high-quality development, and improving the efficiency of social governance. Judicial administrative agencies and notary institutions in various regions have conscientiously implemented the requirements of the Ministry of Justice for reducing certificates and providing convenience to the people, continuously deepening departmental coordination, strengthening innovation promotion, optimizing resource allocation, and improving the notarization system and mechanism for the convenience of enterprises and people. The quality and efficiency of notarial services have been significantly improved, and have been favored by various departments. It has been fully affirmed by the party committee and government at all levels and widely praised by the people.",,,,
"In order to implement the spirit of the National Two Sessions and the deployment requirements on """"strengthening public legal services"""" and implement the State Council\'s work deployment on promoting """"getting one thing done efficiently"""", the Ministry of Justice decided after research to launch """"notarization reduction and convenience for the people"""" across the country. The activity proposed seven measures to improve speed, efficiency and convenience, including shortening the period for applying for certificates, expanding """"one certificate, one application"""", and promoting """"one thing, one stop"""", and required judicial administrative agencies and notary agencies in all regions to adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era As a guide, we must deeply implement Xi Jinping’s thought on the rule of law, start from the needs of the people, and use “getting one thing done efficiently” as the standard, optimize the notarization process, innovate working methods, enhance service capabilities, and effectively improve the quality of notarization services and the efficiency of certificate processing. Provide the people with notarized legal services with a stronger sense of gain.",,,,
Q: What specific measures have been taken to “speed up” the application process?,,,,
"Answer: The focus of the """"Notarization Reduction, Convenience and Speed \u200b\u200bUp"""" activity is to """"increase speed and increase efficiency"""", and the following measures are mainly adopted:",,,,
"The first is to shorten the certificate application period. The Notary Law stipulates that, except for statutory circumstances, the notary institution shall issue a notarization certificate within 15 working days from the date of accepting the notarization application. However, judging from the actual certification situation, there is room for compression in the processing time for some notarization matters (transactions). We sorted out the deadlines for completing notarization matters in various places, comprehensively considered factors such as personnel strength, software and hardware facilities, certification requirements, etc., and formulated the """"Notarization Processing Speed \u200b\u200bUp List"""" for notarization matters (matters) with simple legal relationships, clear facts, and sufficient supporting materials. (2024 Edition)"""", shortening the time limit for issuing a notarial certificate from 15 working days to 5 working days or 10 working days respectively. Among them, a total of 81 notarization matters in 24 categories were issued within 5 working days from the date of acceptance, and a total of 69 items in 13 categories were issued within 10 working days, accounting for 36% and 30% of the total notarization business respectively. At the same time, we encourage notary institutions in various places to take measures such as innovative application methods, optimizing service processes, strengthening business collaboration, and promoting information sharing to further shorten the period for issuing notarial certificates. Notary institutions that are qualified can achieve """"same-day issuance"""" and """"on-the-spot issuance"""" as much as possible. certificate"""". The second is to expand “one certificate, one application”. Summarizing the experience of the """"maximum one visit"""" pilot work since 2017, we have formulated the """"List of Notarization Matters (Affairs) for """"Getting One Thing Efficiently"""" (2024 Edition)"""" to focus on notarization matters with clear legal relationships, clear facts, and no disputes , as long as the parties\' materials are complete, authentic, and meet the statutory acceptance conditions, they only need to go to the notary office once to get the notarization completed. Compared with the """"one time at most"""" work, the scope of notarization matters has been expanded from 22 items in 9 categories to 84 items in 31 categories. The third is to promote “one thing, one stop”. For multiple matters that need to be handled by multiple departments, are highly related, and require relatively concentrated processing time, we encourage notary institutions to handle them in a centralized manner to provide the people with """"one-stop"""" services. For example, through the mutual establishment of service windows, mutually embedded functional modules, and Unicom service systems with the real estate center, we can achieve one-stop processing of """"notarization + real estate registration""""; through the joint operation of """"notarization + consular authentication"""", we can realize foreign-related notarization and consular authentication. """"One application, one window acceptance, and coordinated processing"""" provide the people with notarization and legal services that """"save time, effort, and worry.""""",,,,
Q: How will the Ministry of Justice promote notary institutions in remote areas to implement convenience measures?,,,,
"Answer: There are large differences in the number of notaries and certificate-handling capabilities of notary offices in various regions. This is an objective reality. How to ensure that notary offices in remote areas implement convenience measures will directly affect the overall effectiveness of this event. In this regard, we mainly have the following considerations:",,,,
"The first is to strengthen assistance and cooperation. In the form of """"big hands holding small hands"""", we will promote larger-scale notary institutions to strengthen support for notary institutions in remote areas in terms of notary training, software and hardware construction, etc., and set up certificate processing points, itinerant certificate processing, etc. to meet the needs of people in remote areas for notarization services. . Explore methods such as institutional mergers to adjust and integrate """"small, scattered and weak"""" notary institutions to form large-scale notary institutions with strong service capabilities, so that notarization can be handled """"nearby"""" by the masses. At the same time, notary service resources will be promoted to be stationed in public legal service centers (stations and offices) to further expand the channels for the people to obtain notarial services. The second is to expand the practice area. In recent years, we have expanded the notary practice area in an orderly manner, and most provinces have relaxed it to the provincial level, achieving good results. In order to further explore the expansion of notary practice areas and better serve the coordinated development of regions, we support the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and other regions to explore the integrated handling of more notarization matters, and promote the """"inter-provincial handling"""" of more high-frequency notarization matters to facilitate the public Choose a notary service near you. The third is to strengthen digital empowerment. Vigorously promote the """"Internet + notarization"""" service method, expand the scope of online application, online processing, and online certificate issuance, and promote the application of remote video notarization in remote areas and designated locations, so that people in remote areas can also enjoy smart notarization services.",,,,
"Question: How can enterprises also experience the high-quality and efficient notary services brought by the """"Notarization Reduction, Convenience and Speed \u200b\u200bUp"""" campaign?",,,,
"Answer: In recent years, the state has introduced a series of policies and measures to optimize the business environment and help enterprises develop. Notary agencies in various places have closely focused on the needs of enterprises, innovated service measures, and achieved positive results. For example, Shanghai promotes the establishment of four """"double-one"""" service mechanisms that benefit enterprises, namely, one dedicated window and one channel, one field and one team, one enterprise, one plan, and one park and one list, to provide quick and special services to various market entities. Exclusive service. In response to the characteristics of the free trade zone where enterprises gather and the demand for notarization is concentrated, Hubei relies on the free trade zone management committee to establish a notarial legal service workstation, and takes measures such as on-site duty, regular publicity, and legal medical examinations to deliver notary services to your doorstep. Jiangxi\'s notary industry proactively provides forward-looking services, signing notarial legal service cooperation agreements with more than 300 companies, establishing regular contact mechanisms with more than 1,500 large companies, and setting up offices in administrative service centers at all levels and township convenience centers, industrial parks, enterprises, etc. More than 2,800 notary contact points and convenient certification points provide enterprises with one-on-one """"notarial legal advisors.""""",,,,
"In order to better serve enterprises, we will take the following measures: First, optimize enterprise-related service methods. Guide notary agencies to establish notarization contact points or certification service points in enterprises to provide comprehensive services such as legal consultation, dispute mediation, and notarization matters handling, and encourage qualified notary agencies to fully use information technology to empower service enterprises. The second is to innovate enterprise-related notarization services. Vigorously promote enterprise-related notarization services such as intellectual property protection, listing financing, on-site supervision, bankruptcy and reorganization, provide professional services for corporate equity governance, """"going global"""", etc., and protect the high-quality development of enterprises. The third is to accurately meet the notarization needs of enterprises. Through surveys, discussions, etc., we listen to the legal issues encountered by enterprises in their daily operations, actively respond to their concerns, and provide solid legal protection for optimizing the legalized business environment.",,,,
1. Market review of last week: flat fundamentals but volatile market conditions,,,,
"Last week was the last trading week of 2023. Due to the Christmas holiday, financial markets in Europe and the United States only have four trading days. Last week, the BMD crude brown market and CBOT bean market were volatile, and their performance was relatively flat. However, the U.S. soybeans fell significantly in night trading on the last trading day last Friday. Last week, the U.S. dollar index weakened first and then strengthened, but it had little impact on the external market of agricultural products. The external market of oils and oils mainly reflected recent international fundamental expectations.",,,,
"Recent weather forecasts show that there will be significant rainfall in central Brazil and the core soybean-producing areas of Argentina in at least the first half of January. The soybean harvest in MT state has begun. The recent heavy rainfall may be less beneficial to the yield in MT state than expected, but the yield in other central states will be positive. In the mid-term, the expected bumper harvest of new soybeans in South America is expected to continue to suppress the international oil and fat market. In addition, domestic soybean oil transactions were still relatively light last week, and preparations for the Spring Festival have not yet begun.",,,,
2. Malay Palm Oil: Exports are weak due to normal rainfall and stocks in December may remain unchanged.,,,,
"Yield: The rainfall in the production area in December continued the characteristics of the rainy season. Among them, places such as West Malaysia and Sarawak in East Malaysia, North Sumatra and Riau in Indonesia have experienced relatively heavy rainfall. MPOA previously estimated that horse palm production from December 1 to 20 would decrease by 8.6% month-on-month. SPPOMA estimates that palm oil production in southern West Malaysia will decrease by 10.9% month-on-month in December. Based on rainfall conditions, the month-on-month production data is basically in line with expectations.",,,,
"The five-year average month-on-month decrease in horse palm production in December was 8.2%. Considering that there was too much rainfall in December, the month-on-month decrease in horse palm production should be more than 10%. However, there are about 2 more working days in Malaysia in December than in November. It is expected that the month-on-month decrease in horse palm production in December may be 8-10%.",,,,
Demand side rebounded modestly,,,,
"The overall demand side rebounded moderately in August. After seasonal adjustment, social retail sales in August rose month-on-month (month-on-month +0.4%, previous value +0.5%), among which commodity consumption continued to rebound slightly (month-on-month +0.6%, previous value +0.5%), and catering consumption also rebounded slightly (month-on-month +0.1%, previous value -0.6%); real estate sales continued to decline; fixed asset investment rebounded month-on-month as a whole (month-on-month +0.9%, previous value -5.5%), among which manufacturing investment rebounded compared with the previous month (month-on-month +0.7%), but real estate and infrastructure investment slowed down slightly compared with the previous month (the two were -0.5% and -0.4% month-on-month, respectively).",,,,
Production continues to grow,,,,
"Consistent with the overall mild recovery on the demand side, the production side also improved in August. After seasonal adjustment, industrial added value in August maintained a mild month-on-month positive growth (month-on-month +0.5%, previous value +0.5%), power generation also rebounded significantly (month-on-month +3.0%, previous value +0.6%), and the export delivery value of industrial enterprises also rebounded (month-on-month +0.5%, previous value -0.7%), which was consistent with the month-on-month increase in exports in August.",,,,
Unemployment rate rises further,,,,
"According to seasonally adjusted data, the urban surveyed unemployment rate was 5.3% in August, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous month; after seasonal adjustment, the surveyed unemployment rate in 31 major cities was 5.3%, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous month, which is consistent with the increase in the overall surveyed unemployment rate (0.1 percentage point).",,,,
Economic growth momentum remains weak,,,,
"Although the statistics on both the demand and production sides in August have shown some improvement, we believe that the momentum of economic growth is still weak, and the policy of stabilizing growth still needs to be accelerated. First, the improvement of demand and output depends largely on external demand; second, the recovery of fixed asset investment may be largely supported by the relatively strong monthly data of investment in agriculture, mining, and service industries other than real estate and infrastructure, which are usually less concerned; third, among the major domestic demand sub-items, the recovery of consumption in August is still weak, real estate sales and investment are still declining, and infrastructure investment has also declined. In addition, the seasonally adjusted core CPI in August fell month-on-month, and the employment market continued to be sluggish.",,,,
Policy and institutional adjustments are necessary for the economy to return to the track of recovery,,,,
"In the medium term, considering that the current manufacturing investment continues to maintain momentum, we believe that the transformation of new and old drivers and the logic of China's new economic cycle will still provide certain support to the economy. However, factors such as weak consumer confidence and rising price pressures caused by various factors since the second quarter need to be faced squarely. The risk of downward exports in the middle and late fourth quarter has also increased. Increasing countercyclical adjustments and economic system reforms are still necessary measures to push the economy back on track for recovery (GDP growth exceeding 1.2-1.3% month-on-month).",,,,
"Risk warning: Policies are inconsistent with expectations, unexpected credit risk events occur in real estate, and overseas geopolitical events exceed expectations.",,,,
"Investment is an important way and effective means to stabilize growth and promote development. Focusing on expanding effective investment, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other departments have recently made arrangements in terms of large-scale equipment updates and ultra-long-term special treasury bond projects. Analysts believe that as new measures accelerate their implementation and take effect, investment in related fields is expected to maintain rapid growth and promote the continued expansion of effective investment.",,,,
Investment has maintained steady growth this year,,,,
How has the investment situation been this year? Four sets of data send positive signals——,,,,
"Looking at manufacturing investment, from January to April, manufacturing investment increased by 9.7% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 5.5 percentage points higher than that of all investment; its contribution to the growth of all investment was 54.8%, which was 2.5 percentage points higher than that from January to March.",,,,
"Looking at infrastructure investment, from January to April, infrastructure investment increased by 6% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 1.8 percentage points higher than that of all investment, driving the growth of all investment by 1.3 percentage points.",,,,
"Looking at investment in high-tech industries, from January to April, investment in high-tech industries increased by 11.1% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 6.9 percentage points higher than all investment. Investment in high-tech services increased by 14.5% year-on-year, 1.8 percentage points faster than that from January to March. Among them, investment in e-commerce services increased by 27.6%, investment in information services increased by 19.9%, and investment in science and technology and achievement transformation services increased by 16.5%.",,,,
"Looking at investment in major projects, from January to April, investment in projects with a planned total investment of 100 million yuan and above increased by 10% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 5.8 percentage points higher than all investment, driving the growth of all investment by 5.3 percentage points. Among them, investment in projects with a planned total investment of 1 billion yuan and above increased by 10.1%, and the growth rate was 5.9 percentage points higher than all investment.",,,,
"Liu Aihua, chief economist of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that overall, driven by policies related to actively expanding effective investment, fixed asset investment across the country has maintained steady growth.",,,,
Drive large-scale device updates,,,,
"To further expand effective investment, new measures are being implemented at an accelerated pace, and large-scale equipment updates are one of them.",,,,
"From March this year, the State Council issued the """"Action Plan for Promoting Large-Scale Equipment Updates and Trade-in of Consumer Goods"""", which clearly proposed the implementation of equipment update actions; to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and other seven departments jointly issued the """"Implementation Plan for Promoting Equipment Updates in the Industrial Sector"""", which proposed that by 2027 The scale of annual industrial equipment investment will increase by more than 25% compared with 2023; and then six departments including the National Development and Reform Commission released the """"Implementation Plan for Promoting Equipment Updating in the Cultural and Tourism Fields"""" on May 24, proposing to strive to guide and promote the national equipment upgrade by 2027. A number of facilities and equipment have been updated in the cultural and tourism fields, and the scale of related investment has been maintained to continue to grow steadily... Policies and measures related to large-scale equipment renewal have been introduced one after another.",,,,
"Li Chao, deputy director of the Policy Research Office and spokesperson of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that since the introduction of large-scale equipment renewal and consumer goods trade-in policies, the National Development and Reform Commission and relevant departments have carried out a lot of work in formulating and implementing relevant action plans and policy measures. Increase central investment support for equipment renewal and recycling projects, set up 500 billion yuan in re-loans for technological innovation and technological transformation, and continue to release demand for equipment renewal.",,,,
"Various localities are also speeding up the introduction of policies and measures. On May 28, Anhui Province released an implementation plan to promote large-scale equipment updates and trade-in of consumer goods, proposing that by 2027, the scale of equipment investment in industry, agriculture, construction, transportation, education, cultural tourism, medical and other fields will increase by more than 25% compared with 2023. . On May 14, Zhejiang Province released an implementation plan to promote the scrapping, renewal and construction improvement of facilities and equipment in the agricultural field, proposing to strive to increase the scale of investment in facilities and equipment in the province\'s agricultural field by more than 30% by 2027 compared with 2023.",,,,
"Liu Aihua analyzed that driven by the large-scale equipment update policy, investment in the purchase of equipment and tools increased by 17.2% year-on-year from January to April, 13 percentage points faster than the total investment, driving the growth of the total investment by 2.2 percentage points.",,,,
Make good use of super long-term special government bonds,,,,
"Last year, China issued an additional 1 trillion yuan in government bonds, specifically to support post-disaster recovery and reconstruction and improve disaster prevention and reduction capabilities. How\'s the progress so far?",,,,
"Li Chao introduced that all relevant funds had been distributed to various localities before February this year. The project to issue additional treasury bonds is progressing generally smoothly, and various localities are stepping up efforts to start construction of the projects. So far, of the 15,000 projects that have been implemented, about 11,000 have started construction, with an operating rate of more than 70%. In particular, post-disaster recovery and reconstruction projects have generally made rapid progress. “The National Development and Reform Commission has made a series of arrangements from the whole chain of fund allocation, project promotion and process supervision to ensure that the additional issuance of treasury bonds can not only support post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, improve disaster prevention, reduction and relief capabilities, but also play a role in expanding effective investment, It plays a role in promoting employment, increasing income, and improving living and living conditions,” Li Chao said.",,,,
"The government work report proposed that starting from this year, it plans to issue ultra-long-term special treasury bonds for several consecutive years, specifically for the implementation of major national strategies and the construction of security capabilities in key areas. Li Chao said that the National Development and Reform Commission has made preparations for the issuance of the first batch of ultra-long-term special treasury bond projects, and has sorted out a number of major projects that meet the requirements for the implementation of major national strategies and security capacity building in key areas and can be immediately released for investment. Once the treasury bond funds are in place, Construction can then be accelerated.",,,,
"""""In the next stage, we must make good use of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds, accelerate the issuance and use of special bonds, and continue to vigorously promote the construction of major projects in the \'14th Five-Year Plan\'."""" said Luo Yifei, chief statistician of the Investment Department of the National Bureau of Statistics. Action plans for upgrading large-scale equipment and replacing old consumer goods with new ones will continue to release consumption and investment potential; actively cultivate and expand strategic emerging industries, and use advanced technology to empower the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries; implement new mechanisms for cooperation between government and social capital to fully stimulate the vitality of private investment; Promote the continuous expansion of effective investment and promote the high-quality development of investment.

"Event: The Federal Reserve released a statement on the January FOMC meeting at 3 a.m. Beijing time on February 1, announcing that it would keep interest rates unchanged.",,,,
Statement and press conference highlights,,,,
1. The Federal Reserve announced that it will keep interest rates unchanged and the balance sheet reduction will continue in an orderly manner according to the May 2022 plan.,,,,
"2. The Federal Reserve reiterated its determination to control inflation. The Fed\'s statement is quite different from that in December 2023. First, in terms of the U.S. economy, it is believed that economic activities are expanding steadily, but in December 2023, the growth rate of economic activities is thought to have slowed down; second, this statement has deleted relevant statements about the U.S. banking industry and financial environment, but It said that the economic outlook is unclear; third, it said that it would not be appropriate to lower the target range before becoming more confident that inflation will continue to move toward 2%, and reiterated its determination to control inflation levels.",,,,
"3. At the press conference, Powell expressed a more hawkish stance, with patience and flexibility being the key words. Judging from Powell\'s speech and stance at the press conference, Powell is cautious about the timing of subsequent interest rate cuts. In terms of the timing of interest rate cuts, Powell believes that the policy interest rate is already at the peak of this interest rate hike cycle, and it will be appropriate to cut interest rates at some point this year, but a March interest rate cut is not the current baseline assumption. Under appropriate circumstances, there is a readiness to keep interest rates at current levels for a longer period of time. We still need to see more evidence of declining inflation. We are still in risk management mode, and the timing of interest rate cuts still depends on the performance of inflation data. Although the U.S. economy is currently performing well, it cannot yet declare that the U.S. economy has reached a soft landing. The Federal Reserve has not There is no economic growth mandate.",,,,
The Fed may be more flexible and pragmatic in controlling the pace of interest rate cuts,,,,
"1. Possible explanations for the current """"hawkish"""" attitude of the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy. First, the current U.S. economy is indeed performing well and does not support rapid interest rate cuts. Although the overall inflation level continues to decline, what needs to be noted is that the U.S. labor market is still relatively tight. If monetary policy is relaxed quickly, inflation expectations may relapse; secondly, the market has been relatively positive in pricing interest rate cuts in the early stage, and the Federal Reserve needs to """"snap back"""" """"Policy and expectation management leadership. The early market pricing of the Fed\'s interest rate cut was very positive, which may have a negative impact on the transmission effect of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve needs to effectively guide market expectations to prevent market interest rate cut expectations from deviating too much from economic fundamentals.",,,,
"2. The Federal Reserve may be more flexible and pragmatic in controlling the pace of interest rate cuts. Combining the current economic data with the information from this meeting, we believe that the second quarter is the first observation node for interest rate cuts: first, the inflation level is expected to further decrease at that time, and the Federal Reserve can observe more and more comprehensive data, which is in line with Powell\'s We need to see more good data; secondly, falling inflation means that real policy interest rates will also rise further, economic pressure will increase, and the labor market may also see changes. In terms of specific pace, we believe that the Federal Reserve will be very flexible. If the economy changes rapidly, the pace of interest rate cuts will also change accordingly. Both 25bp and 50bp may be options for interest rate cuts. In terms of shrinking the balance sheet, the same flexible attitude may be adopted.",,,,
The market reacted fiercely to the Fed\'s statement,,,,
"After the press conference, risk assets recorded a large decline. In terms of U.S. stocks, after the press conference, U.S. stocks fell sharply. In the end, the Dow Jones Index and the Nasdaq Index closed down 0.82% and 2.23% respectively. In terms of U.S. bonds, after the press conference, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell. In terms of the US dollar, it rose after the press conference. Interest rate futures indicate that the Federal Reserve is likely not to cut interest rates in March.",,,,
Risk warning: Tensions in the international situation trigger higher-than-expected inflation.,,,,
"Prices continued to stabilize year-on-year in May, with structural differentiation. 1) The strongest price performances are pork, which is affected by the reduction of pig production capacity; coal, which is driven by both supply and demand; non-ferrous metals, which are driven by international market factors; and ferrous metals, which are driven by domestic equipment update policies. 2) With domestic demand weak, travel has shown a """"volume increase and price decrease""""; the month-on-month declines in prices of furniture, utensils and transportation have expanded; the procyclical rental item continues to be weak; building material prices continue to decline, and the physical volume of infrastructure needs to be accelerated. 3) The main reason for the weak prices in the equipment manufacturing industry lies on the supply side.",,,,
"CPI and PPI were slightly better than expected year-on-year, with CPI continuing to be stronger than seasonally on a month-on-month basis. In May, the CPI was 0.3% year-on-year (previous value: 0.3%), and the consensus forecast value of Wind was 0.4%; the PPI was -1.4% year-on-year (previous value: -2.5%), and the consensus forecast value of Wind was -1.5%. The CPI in May was -0.1% month-on-month, stronger than seasonal for two consecutive months (the month-on-month average for the same period from 2016 to 2019 was -0.2%, and the month-on-month average for the same period from 2020 to 2023 was -0.4%); PPI was 0.2% month-on-month, basically the same as Seasonality (the month-on-month average for the same period from 2016 to 2019 is 0.2%, and the month-on-month average for the same period from 2020 to 2023 is 0.1%).",,,,
"The main driver of CPI is food, energy and core performance were weaker than seasonal. Food prices in May were flat month-on-month, while they were negative in seven of the eight years from 2016 to 2023. Among them, the prices of fresh fruits, pork, and eggs increased month-on-month and were stronger than seasonal prices. The impact of reductions in pig production capacity has emerged, with pork prices rising 1.1% month-on-month and 4.6% year-on-year. Except for food items, energy and core price performance were weaker than seasonal. Affected by changes in international oil prices, the fuel item fell by 0.8% month-on-month. Core and service CPI fell by 0.2% and 0.1% respectively month-on-month, which was weaker than seasonal. From a price point of view, travel during the May Day holiday this year is not as popular as the Spring Festival. The average travel sub-item from April to May increased by 1.1% month-on-month, which was lower than the average of 1.4% in the same period from 2020 to 2023. The household services sub-item was 0.1% month-on-month and 1.8% year-on-year, showing average performance. The rent component was -0.1% month-on-month, which was weaker than seasonal. The performance of core consumer products is divided. Clothing items are on the strong side. The month-on-month decline in furniture and utensils expanded to -1.1%. The month-on-month decline in transportation expanded to -0.9%.",,,,
"Low base, coal and non-ferrous metal prices support PPI. After falling month-on-month for six consecutive months, the price of means of production turned to increase by 0.4% month-on-month in May, while the price of means of living remained at -0.1% month-on-month for four consecutive months. Looking at different industries, the decline in international oil prices drove the price of the oil and natural gas extraction industry to fall by 2.1%. Coal prices rose 0.5% month-on-month, which was stronger than the seasonal trend. The supply of coal in the main producing areas was tight, and the demand for restocking during the """"summer peak"""" was gradually released. It is expected that there will be little room for further decline in domestic coal prices. Affected by the rise in non-ferrous metal prices in the international market, prices in the domestic non-ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry increased by 3.9%. Policies such as large-scale equipment updates are gradually coming into effect, and the steel market is expected to improve. Prices in the ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry increased by 0.8%. Building materials prices continued to decline, with glass manufacturing and cement manufacturing prices falling by 1.2% and 0.8% respectively. Except for the slightly better performance of the railway, shipbuilding, aerospace and other transportation equipment manufacturing industries, the overall performance of the equipment manufacturing industry was weaker than seasonal. The prices of lithium-ion battery manufacturing and new energy vehicle manufacturing fell by 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. The overall performance of the consumer goods manufacturing industry was weak, and the performance of textile and apparel was slightly better.",,,,

"In July, the negative growth of M1 deepened and the real estate adjustment was not completed.",,,,
"Economic growth: The nominal GDP growth rate slowed down to 4.1% in the first half of the year; the year-on-year growth of the industrial economy slowed down by 0.1 percentage point to +5.9% in July (maintaining positive growth month-on-month), and the service economy rebounded by 0.1 percentage point to +4.8% year-on-year. Inflation: In July, upstream and downstream prices performed better than midstream prices. Among them, upstream prices improved by 2.9 percentage points, midstream prices improved by 1.7 percentage points (cement prices continued to rise), and downstream prices improved by 0.1 percentage points. The price difference structure between regions remained differentiated in July, among which Hainan and Guizhou had larger positive differences, reflecting the synergistic characteristics of regional strategies, which is conducive to the repair of the profit statements of industrial enterprises in related regions and the improvement of local government debt pressure.",,,,
"Investment and production: The cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in July continued to decline slightly to +3.6% compared with June, and the month-on-month growth rate fell slightly to -0.17%. In terms of investment structure, investment in transportation equipment (+30.1%), water conservancy (+28.9%), food production (+26.8%), electricity, heat, gas and water production (+23.8%) and agricultural and sideline products (+21.2%) was still significantly faster than that in manufacturing (down 0.2 percentage points to +9.5%); in terms of output structure, capacity reduction slowed down.

The growth rate fell slightly to 8.7% in July. Real estate investment fell 0.1 percentage point year-on-year to -10.2% in July, but from a seasonal perspective, the pressure of inventory digestion in July was reduced compared with June.",,,,
"The pressure of physical demand has not been eliminated, and attention should be paid to short-term rebound",,,,
"After the loosening of real estate policies, it is difficult to improve consumption expectations (still in the process of adjustment). Coupled with the relatively limited intensity of fiscal spending in the first half of the year, the market is further cautious. The negative growth of M1 in July deepened, and short-term physical consumption is still under pressure. It still takes time for the policy to be implemented and the actual improvement of industry consumption and investment. The slow improvement of price indicators in July proves this point. With the gradual improvement of fiscal spending in August, the probability of steepening of the interest rate curve has further increased. We continue to wait for the positive allocation after the release of short-term adjustment risks.",,,,

"Domestic Economy: Domestic economic data for May were released, and social consumption and exports supported the expansion of the domestic economic aggregate.",,,,
"On June 17, the National Bureau of Statistics released economic data for May. Overall, total retail sales of consumer goods rebounded, and the growth rate of fixed asset investment fell slightly. Among them, the growth rate of manufacturing and infrastructure investment slowed down marginally, and the growth rate of real estate investment continued to fall. Social consumption increased by 3.7% year-on-year in May, compared with the previous value of 2.3%. Looking at the retail sales of enterprises above designated size, the growth rate of grain and oil, clothing, cosmetics, daily necessities, home appliances, furniture, communication equipment, and petroleum consumption rebounded marginally, and the consumption of gold, silver and jewelry The growth rate has declined marginally. In May, national fixed asset investment increased by 4% year-on-year, compared with 4.2% in the previous month. The growth rate of manufacturing investment still exceeded that of infrastructure investment. In terms of items, manufacturing investment was 9.6% (previous value 9.7%); infrastructure investment was 6.68% (previous value 7.78%), infrastructure investment (excluding electricity) was 5.7% (previous value 6%); real estate Investment in development was -10.1% (previously -9.8%). Specifically, the progress of local special bond issuance is slower than the same period in previous years, capital investment has not improved, and the growth rate of infrastructure investment has slowed down marginally. Although the growth rate of manufacturing investment has slowed down slightly, it still maintains a high growth rate. Although new real estate policies have been introduced in various places since April, sales and investment in real estate commercial housing have been weak. In May, RMB loans increased by 950 billion yuan, a decrease of about 410 billion yuan year-on-year, and the existing growth rate was 9.3% year-on-year. Since April, deposit data has continued to be weak year-on-year due to the impact of weak credit, the pace of fiscal revenue and expenditure, the transfer of residents' deposits to financial management, the prevention of arbitrage and idling of funds, and the prohibition of manual interest payments and high interest rates to attract deposits. Among them, M1 fell by 4.1% year-on-year. %. Specifically, bill financing increased by 357.2 billion yuan, with an increase of approximately 315.2 billion yuan; household loans increased by 75.7 billion yuan, a decrease of approximately 291.5 billion yuan year-on-year, of which short-term loans increased by 24.3 billion yuan, and medium and long-term loans increased by 51.4 billion yuan. , an increase of approximately 174.5 and 117 billion yuan respectively year-on-year; loans to enterprises (institutions) increased by 740 billion yuan, a decrease of approximately 115.8 billion yuan year-on-year. Among them, short-term loans decreased by 120 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 155 billion yuan year-on-year. Long-term loans increased by 500 billion yuan, a decrease of approximately 269.8 billion yuan year-on-year. In May, the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PII) was 49.5%, a decrease of 0.9 percentage points from the previous month, indicating that the prosperity level of the manufacturing industry has declined. From the perspective of sub-indices, among the five sub-indices that make up the manufacturing PII, the production index and supplier delivery time index are higher than the critical point, while the new order index, raw material inventory index and employee index are lower than the critical point. Among them, the new orders index was 49.6%, a decrease of 1.5 percentage points from the previous month, indicating that the manufacturing market demand has slowed down. The raw material inventory index was 47.8%, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from the previous month, indicating that the inventory of major raw materials in the manufacturing industry has decreased.",,,,
"Looking forward to the second half of the year, the tone of monetary policy will continue to be """"sound monetary policy must be flexible, moderate, precise and effective."""" There are conflicts between multiple objectives of monetary policy. We believe that the weight of financial stability has increased at this stage. Under the trade-off, currency will present a new supply paradigm from price to quantity.",,,,
"New paradigm of currency operation: different interest rate cuts and the eye-catching RRR cut. There may still be two LPR cuts this year, totaling 20-40 BP, one MLF cut of 10-20 BP, and the 50 BP RRR cut in the third quarter is """"different"""" The interest rate cut has four meanings: 1. Reduce deposits first, then reduce loans; 2. Maintain the MLF and lower the LPR; 3. Increase the LPR point reduction range to guide the housing loan interest rate downward; 4. Use structural monetary policy tools to achieve structural goals. Sexual interest rate cut. LPR may be lowered by 10-20BP in the third quarter. If the PSL is restarted, the PSL interest rate may be reduced by 25-30BP. The central bank temporarily bypasses the transmission path of MLF→LPR→loan interest rate/deposit interest rate. LPR is no longer the benchmark interest rate and is temporarily used as the policy interest rate. The neutral assumption is that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the first time in September, and may return to the conventional interest rate transmission system, and may simultaneously lower MLF10-20BP and LPR10-20BP in the fourth quarter. Structural liquidity tension may occur in the third quarter, and the central bank has temporarily lowered the reserve requirement ratio by 50BP. The reduction in deposit interest rates will continue during the year, deposits will be transferred to financial management, funds will flow from major banks to non-banks, and the liquidity of major banks will be relatively tight. The liability structure of banks will change, and deposits will be transferred to bonds. Commercial banks will need to increase their excess deposit reserve ratio to deal with liquidity risks. Lowering the reserve requirement ratio releases liquidity to achieve the triple goals of coordinating fiscal coordination, saving bank costs and increasing the money multiplier to boost M2.",,,,
"A new paradigm of currency investment: different base currency injection. The central bank is likely to start regular operations of buying and selling government bonds in the open market within the year. China\'s monetary policy still has room for normal operation. The central bank\'s buying and selling of government bonds is a way to enrich the policy toolbox and increase the injection of base money, rather than controlling long-term interest rates. Conventional monetary policy operations mean that the central bank\'s policy focus is still on controlling short-term interest rates, so the most likely target of the central bank\'s operations is short-term government bonds. We believe that there may be two situations that prompt the central bank to take action: 1. The central bank cannot effectively inject base money through other methods and continues to shrink its balance sheet; 2. The central bank needs to maintain the normal upward sloping shape of the yield curve. Of course, if sharp fluctuations in interest rates occur that may trigger financial risks, the central bank may use long-term buying and selling operations in the short term to respond.",,,,
"New paradigm of currency derivation: expanding from endogenous currency to exogenous currency. Driven by government financing, the growth rate of social financing may rise steadily to 8.7% in the third quarter, but fall slightly to 8.3% in the fourth quarter. Credit growth increased in the third quarter, and the currency derived from it is expected to become a stabilizer for M2 growth. The full-year M2 growth rate is expected to be 7.7%. The central bank can increase base money and hope to lower the reserve requirement ratio to push up the money multiplier to maintain M2 growth at a policy-consensus level of slightly above 8%. However, the money multiplier has multiple influencing factors that the central bank can only influence and cannot control. Under the background that credit supply and demand have shifted from supply constraints to demand constraints, revitalizing the stock and preventing idling of funds, the desired growth rate of M2 cannot be achieved solely by credit derivation, that is, endogenous money. It also needs to form a synergy with fiscal policy to increase net fiscal expenditures. , that is, exogenous monetary assistance.",,,,

"The first economic data of the year was released, and overall it was better than expected. The overall economy may be stable. From January to February 2024, the year-on-year growth rates of industrial added value and fixed asset investment were both higher than iFind’s consensus expectations; the year-on-year growth rate of total retail sales of consumer goods was basically the same as the consensus expectations. Overall, economic performance from January to February was better than market expectations. The monthly GDP index we calculated shows that GDP growth in January-February 2024 may be slightly higher than 6%. The economy\'s """"good start"""" has laid a good foundation for achieving the annual economic target of 5%. On March 6, the National Development and Reform Commission stated at the economic press conference of the Second Session of the National People\'s Congress that the expected economic growth target of about 5% can be achieved with a positive attitude and hard work. On March 18, the Bureau of Statistics stated that the expected economic growth target of about 5% is conditional and supported, and can be achieved through hard work. It is not difficult to find that government departments have further strengthened their confidence in achieving the full-year goals.",,,,
"First of all, """"new productive forces"""" provide strong support to industrial production. This year\'s National People\'s Congress and the People\'s Political Consultative Conference will place accelerating the development of new productive forces at the top of the government\'s work in 2024. In 2023, the year-on-year added value of industrial added value was once higher than that of high-tech manufacturing. From January to February 2024, the growth rate of high-tech manufacturing added value exceeded that of industrial growth. However, it should be noted that the power generation of the secondary industry in January and February was higher than the industrial added value, and the potential impact of the energy consumption target needs to be tracked.",,,,
"The year-on-year growth rate of manufacturing investment has increased, and investment in technological transformation is expected to usher in a new round of upward growth. From January to February, manufacturing investment increased by 9.4% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 2.9 percentage points higher than last year. Investment in technological transformation is a highlight of this period’s manufacturing investment. According to data released by the Bureau of Statistics, technological transformation investment accounts for about 40% of manufacturing investment. From 2017 to 2021, the growth rate of technological transformation investment continued to be higher than that of manufacturing investment. However, from 2022 to 2023, the growth rate of technological transformation investment will be has declined, and the growth rate has dropped to 3.8% in 2023. The growth rate of investment in technological transformation rose sharply to 15.1% from January to February. We believe that with the support of policies that promote large-scale equipment renewal, investment in technological transformation is expected to usher in a new round of rising period.",,,,
"The third driving force of the economy is that residents’ service consumption remains strong. Holidays at the beginning of the year boosted service consumption. From January to February, the service industry production index increased by 5.5% year-on-year, and service retail sales increased by 12.3% year-on-year. High-frequency data shows that subway passenger volume in first-tier cities hit a record high for the same period in the first two weeks of March, and the congestion index is also at a historical high, reflecting that residents are still traveling hotly after the Spring Festival holiday. The characteristic that service consumption performs better than that of goods consumption continues.",,,,
"The structural concern of the economy still lies in real estate. At the beginning of the year, real estate continued to decline, and the differentiation from other sectors expanded. From January to February, national real estate development investment fell by 9.0% year-on-year, narrowing compared with the full-year decline in 2023. We believe that the improvement of real estate investment mainly comes from policy support for the supply side: first, the regulatory authorities have repeatedly emphasized that they should meet the reasonable financing needs of real estate companies of different ownerships equally and increase financial support for real estate companies; second, we expect that """"three """"Big projects"""" are becoming the new focus of real estate investment. But from the demand side, real estate sales remain sluggish. Residents\' housing price expectations and home buying confidence still need to be restored.",,,,
Risk factors: Significant tightening of policies; overseas economic downturn has a larger-than-expected impact on exports.,,,,
"Event: On May 31, the National Bureau of Statistics released May PMI data. The manufacturing PMI was 49.50%, the previous value was 50.40%; the non-manufacturing PMI was 51.10%, the previous value was 51.20%.",,,,
"The manufacturing PMI in May was 49.50%, lower than the boom-bust line, and manufacturing economic activities have slowed down. Overall economic activity in the manufacturing sector has slowed. Taken together, both the supply and demand components of the PMI fell marginally in May, but production is still better than demand. On the production side, the production index in May dropped 2.1pct from April to 50.80%. On the demand side, both the new orders and export order index in May fell compared with April. The new order index fell 1.5 pct from April to 49.60% in May, and the new export order index fell 2.3 pct from April to 48.30%.",,,,
"The non-manufacturing business activity index in May was 51.10%, down 0.1pct from the previous month, but still above the boom-bust line.

The business activity index of the service industry in May was 50.50%, an increase of 0.2pct from the previous month. The demand for the May Day holiday drove the related service industries to perform better.",,,,
"Overall, manufacturing activity in May was weaker than seasonal. While demand turned to contraction, production expansion also slowed.

"The overall year-on-year inflation growth rate in October fell slightly compared with September; in terms of CPI, food items are the main reason for dragging down inflation growth. Sufficient supply is the main reason for the month-on-month decline in food prices.

"The year-on-year CPI growth rate fell back to the negative growth range again. In October, the year-on-year CPI growth rate fell back to the negative growth range again, lower than market expectations, indicating that the negative impact of weak demand on prices is still relatively obvious. The decline in CPI year-on-year growth rate was mainly dragged down by food prices. In October, food prices affected the month-on-month CPI decrease by about 0.14 percentage points, and the year-on-year CPI decrease was about 0.75 percentage points. The main drag on food price performance was eggs, pork, fresh vegetables and water. Product prices, etc. But in addition, the year-on-year growth rate of core inflation has also declined compared with September, indicating that in addition to food prices being affected by sufficient supply, the performance of the demand side is still weak. Although the year-on-year CPI growth rate in October was weak and fell back into the negative growth range, we believe that the overall trend of inflation bottoming out has not changed, and under the influence of the low base, it is expected that the year-on-year CPI growth rate in November will return to positive growth. within the range.",,,,

In January and February of this year, 6 typical cases of rectifying formalism to reduce the burden on the grassroots were reported. We work recklessly regardless of objective reality, pursue short-term benefits at the expense of long-term development in a one-sided manner, have too many and overburdened assessment tasks, and the problem of """"formalism at our fingertips"""" is still prominent... Some are old problems, and some are new situations, reflecting the strict avoidance of formalities in some regions. The awareness of doctrine and bureaucracy is still not strong enough.

"Since 2023, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy adjustments have entered a deep water zone, and the sharp rise in U.S. bond interest rates has triggered global financial turmoil. As a large and open emerging market economy, China will still be affected. This article supplements the foreign exchange framework based on a series of previous studies, and attempts to analyze the transmission mechanism of the Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments to the domestic bond market.",,,,
"Exchange rate is an inescapable transmission channel for domestic financial markets. Theoretically, the market-oriented reform of the RMB exchange rate can not only improve the autonomy of monetary policy and thereby reduce the spillover effects of the Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments, but it may also increase new risk points. On the one hand, the market-oriented exchange rate reform requires the cooperation of financial openness, and the impact of cross-border capital flows and carry trade on the RMB exchange rate is gradually increasing; on the other hand, investors can read more economic fundamentals and policies from the two-way fluctuations in exchange rate prices. information. If it is only differences in monetary policy stance that trigger exchange rate fluctuations, the Fed\'s spillover impact will be relatively controllable; if more is caused by changes in the economic outlook, the Fed\'s spillover impact may be greater.",,,,
"The Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments may affect domestic interest rate bonds through four channels: cross-border capital flows, exchange rates, monetary policy and risk preferences. As two-way financial opening up and interest rate liberalization reforms continue to advance, the response of interest rate bonds to the Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments has declined. Cross-border capital flows and carry trades have become more prominent, while the increased degree of exchange rate marketization has increased the autonomy of monetary policy, thereby reducing the spillover impact of the Federal Reserve on interest rate bonds. However, when the Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments reflect more changes in the economic outlook, the response of domestic interest rate bonds will increase significantly. This may be related to factors such as China’s monetary policy that prioritizes stabilizing growth, rising demand for safe havens in financial markets, and China’s foreign-related departments not fearing tightening of U.S. dollar liquidity. China\'s credit bond market is still in the process of market-oriented reform, and has long-standing problems of """"debts in name only but real loans"""", so it is closer to monetary policy and domestic economic fundamentals.",,,,
"The empirical results verify the transmission impact of the four channels on the foreign exchange market and the domestic bond market one by one. Increased exchange rate flexibility can absorb external shocks, improve monetary policy autonomy, and reduce the impact of the Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments on the bond market. The seesaw between the RMB central parity rate and the U.S. dollar mostly occurs when the Federal Reserve adjusts its monetary policy stance. Changes in the economic outlook implied by the FOMC meeting may cause the RMB central parity rate to rise and fall simultaneously with the U.S. dollar. At the same time, the economic outlook reflected by the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy has a greater impact on ChinaBond. When the Fed\'s tightening leads to a deterioration of the economic outlook, rather than a """"soft landing"""" passive tightening, the """"stock-bond seesaw"""" effect becomes prominent. In addition, there is no stable pattern between changes in domestic inter-bank liquidity, offshore RMB interest rates and the Fed\'s monetary policy adjustments.",,,,

CPI inflation trend: overall and core continue to cool down,,,,
"Year-on-year, both the overall and core CPI inflation in July declined further. In terms of trend, the overall CPI year-on-year trend broke through the 3% platform and fell to a new low since March 2021; the core CPI fell steadily year-on-year, maintaining a downward trend for four consecutive months. In July, the year-on-year """"scissors gap"""" between the US CPI and the core CPI was 0.3%, the same as last month.",,,,
CPI inflation structure: multiple core sub-items turned negative month-on-month,,,,
"Looking at the month-on-month CPI structure, except for the month-on-month increase of energy commodity prices, which was higher than the average level in the past 12 months, the month-on-month growth rates of other components were lower than the average level in the past 12 months. In the non-core part of inflation, affected by imported factors, fuel prices rose significantly, with a month-on-month growth rate of 1.9% in July, making the largest contribution to the energy commodity part. Food inflation shows signs of stabilizing, with food prices fluctuating within a narrow range of 0-0.2% for six consecutive months. In the core part of inflation, the month-on-month decline in core commodity prices further expanded, falling by 0.3% month-on-month, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from the previous month\'s decline. Among them, the price of second-hand cars fluctuated violently, falling 2.3% month-on-month in a single month, which was the largest decline in the core commodity segment. The core service component of inflation has also cooled significantly. The medical sub-category, which previously had the highest month-on-month increase in CPI, saw a month-on-month increase of -0.3%, falling to the lowest level in nearly 12 months.",,,,
"Overall, compared with the previous month, the decline in inflation in July was more comprehensive, with the month-on-month growth rates of all core CPI secondary sub-items lower than the average level of the past 12 months, and the proportion of sub-items showing negative month-on-month growth was close to 50%.",,,,
"In terms of contribution, core services were still the largest contributor to CPI in July, contributing 0.19% growth. However, core commodities replaced energy as the largest negative contributor to CPI, contributing -0.06% growth in July, and maintained negative contribution for five consecutive months.",,,,
"From the perspective of the super core inflation (excluding the core service part of housing) that the Federal Reserve is concerned about, the super core part\'s contribution to CPI turned from negative to positive in July, contributing 0.053% growth. This is mainly because the transportation service sub-item with a larger weight in the super core part turned from negative to positive in July, contributing 0.027% growth in CPI.",,,,
Policy Outlook: The weight of inflation in the “dual targets” may have been postponed,,,,
"U.S. inflation maintained good progress both overall and structurally in July. Combined with the Fed’s July meeting’s “need to balance the risks of rising inflation and weaker employment,” we believe that considering the lag effect of monetary policy transmission, the magnitude and pace of the Fed’s interest rate cuts will be more based on the employment market conditions than inflation, in order to achieve the policy goal of a “soft landing.”",,,,

US CPI fell rapidly in August,,,,
"Inflation fell rapidly again in August, but core inflation unexpectedly rose month-on-month, and the market revised expectations for interest rate cuts. For the Federal Reserve, the August inflation figure (+2.5%, a significant slowdown in growth) combined with the August unemployment rate figure (4.2%, a slight decline), while strengthening the market’s macro concerns about the U.S. economic “recession” , correcting the market’s macro space for pricing the first interest rate cut in September. The federal funds rate futures market has converged on the Fed\'s pricing of a September interest rate cut - lowering its bets on a September interest rate cut from 50 BP to 25 BP.",,,,
"Interest rates can be cut, but the prospect of further rate cuts is unclear. Pay attention to the risk of rising liquidity pressure in September. From the perspective of the structure of US inflation, the decline in oil prices has made a significant contribution to the downward trend in inflation in August; however, we believe that it is worth noting that the US core CPI has stabilized and rebounded. Although the salary growth rate in August only fell by 0.1 percentage point, if the rental costs caused by rising house prices rise further in the future, prices will fall due to the slowdown in demand, but """"inflation"""" will rise due to the resilience of costs - which will limit the space and expectations of the central bank to take """"interest rate cuts"""" for countercyclical economic regulation.",,,,

"Under the state of """"inflation"""", the market is also pricing in a """"cooling"""" macroeconomic environment. The dilemma of the central bank\'s policy in the future will increase the short-term liquidity risk of the market, and pay attention to domestic policy hedging. From the perspective of the foreign exchange market, the market\'s pricing of the Fed\'s September rate cut has been reduced (from 50BP to 25BP), that is, the probability of a rebound in the actual interest rate of US Treasury bonds has increased, and the judgment of a steepening curve has been maintained; on the other hand, the establishment of domestic market confidence still depends on the opening of fiscal policy space and the further effective coordination of fiscal and monetary policies to reverse the objective reality of """"asset shortage"""". Therefore, we believe that short-term monetary policy expectations still have loose pricing of """"rate cuts"""".

"Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 29, Title: Strengthening basic research from the perspective of """"Ten Major Progress in Chinese Science"""" - Relevant person in charge of the National Natural Science Foundation of China answers reporters\' questions",,,,
Xinhua News Agency reporter Hu Zhe,,,,
"On February 29, the National Natural Science Foundation of China released the """"Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science"""" for 2023. What are the characteristics of the top ten latest developments? What\'s the significance? The relevant person in charge of the National Natural Science Foundation of China accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency.",,,,
Reporter: What are the characteristics of the “Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science” in 2023?,,,,
"Answer: The scientific research results selected for the 2023 """"Top Ten Advances in Chinese Science"""" are oriented to the world\'s scientific and technological frontiers, highlight originality, reflect multi-disciplinary intersections, and present the following characteristics:",,,,
"Judging from the distribution of subject fields and research results, the """"Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science"""" in 2023 is mainly distributed in the scientific fields of life sciences and medicine, artificial intelligence, quantum, astronomy, chemical energy, etc. The research results fully reflect the """"four aspects"""" The strategic orientation reflects the expansion of research directions to macro, micro and extreme conditions, and reflects the formation of a new paradigm in basic research promoted by big data and intelligence.",,,,
"From the perspective of selection principles and procedures, the 2023 """"Top Ten Progress in Science in China"""" adheres to the principle of relying on experts and is recommended by a third party. It does not require the application and defense of the person who completed the results. The final selection is made by more than 2,100 high-level experts and scholars in the field of basic research. More than 430 academicians of the two academies participated in the voting, ensuring the scientificity, fairness and representativeness of the selection results. In particular, this year, the Advisory Committee of the National Natural Science Foundation of China organized experts to review and check the results that were finally selected into the """"Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science"""" in 2023, which improved the authority of the selection results.",,,,
"Judging from the main completing units and personnel, in addition to universities and scientific research institutes, three technology companies have been shortlisted for the """"Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science"""" in 2023, including Huawei Cloud Computing Technology Co., Ltd. and Syngenta Group , Beijing Qihe Shengke Biotechnology Co., Ltd., etc., reflecting the increasingly important role that enterprises play in innovation. This year, an important result in the field of life sciences jointly researched by the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology was selected, reflecting the increasingly prominent role of Hong Kong and Macao’s scientific and technological strength in the national science and technology innovation system.",,,,
"In addition, many of the selected results were completed through joint research by universities, scientific research institutes, etc., reflecting the unique advantages and outstanding results of organized scientific research relying on the national strategic scientific and technological strength. In terms of main completion personnel, 45% are under the age of 45, and 72% have received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars or Innovation Group Projects. It can be seen that young talents have become a new force in carrying out basic research. The National Natural Science Foundation of China Science funds play an increasingly important role as the main channel in supporting basic research and cultivating scientific and technological innovation talents.",,,,
Reporter: What is the significance of holding this selection and release event?,,,,
"Answer: The """"Top Ten Progress in Science in China"""" selection activity aims to publicize the major progress made in basic research in our country, stimulate the scientific enthusiasm of the majority of scientific and technological workers, promote the scientific spirit and the spirit of scientists, and create a strong scientific research atmosphere in the whole society. The scientific research achievements selected as the """"Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science"""" in 2023 are breakthroughs and landmark achievements in their respective fields. These important achievements are the epitome and representative of the gratifying progress made in basic research in our country.",,,,
"In a sense, the innovation environment is more important than the innovation itself. Basic research is characterized by instant inspiration, random methods, and uncertain paths. Therefore, we must maintain strategic focus on basic research and vigorously create a good innovation environment that encourages originality, tolerates failure, and is conducive to the production of major original results.",,,,
"Promoting the major scientific and technological achievements selected and released in the """"Top Ten Progress of Chinese Science"""" in 2023 is also an important science popularization activity for the whole society. It is a popular science expression of scientific and technological resources and helps to improve the scientific literacy of the whole people.",,,,
"Reporter: Taking this selection and release event as an opportunity, what new measures does the National Natural Science Foundation of China have to strengthen basic research, especially to cultivate high-level scientific and technological talents?",,,,
"Answer: Strengthening basic research ultimately depends on high-level talents. We must take the release of the """"Top Ten Progress in Chinese Science"""" in 2023 as an opportunity to adhere to the goal-oriented and free exploration of """"walking on two legs"""", stabilize the fundamentals of basic research, improve support for non-consensus and transformative innovative research, and expand understanding Natural boundaries open up new cognitive territories; it is necessary to improve the establishment, review and management mechanisms of major projects, understand the basic theories and technical principles behind the """"stuck neck"""" technology, and allocate precious scientific resources to those with the most vitality and innovation potential frontline scientific researchers.",,,,
"The key to strengthening basic research and laying a solid foundation for self-reliance in high-level science and technology is to raise real scientific questions in terms of research content, combine basic research with talent training in terms of talent teams, improve the diversified investment mechanism in terms of research investment, and in terms of innovation subjects Give full play to the leading role of the national strategic scientific and technological strength and create an innovative culture of """"bravely venturing into no man\'s land"""" in the scientific research environment.",,,,
"Specifically, the first is to move the funding port of the National Natural Science Foundation forward and pilot-fund outstanding undergraduates and doctoral students to carry out basic research. Explore and build a systematic and full-chain talent team support and training mechanism that starts from undergraduates and runs through the entire career of scientists.",,,,
"The second is to optimize the funding mechanism of the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars. Highlight the attributes of the project, conduct a graded evaluation of the project completion when the funding period expires, and continue funding for those with excellent evaluation results. A maximum of 15 years of long-term stable funding of nearly 30 million yuan will be provided, and superior resources will be concentrated to cultivate high-level leading talents.",,,,
"The third is to build an international basic research cooperation platform, establish a global scientific research fund, and carry out international scientific research funding. This includes funding scientific research projects jointly conducted by Chinese and foreign scientists, supporting overseas scientists to work in China for a long time, encouraging outstanding foreign doctoral students to study in China or engage in scientific research, etc., to accumulate more original innovations and make new and greater contributions to the development and progress of human civilization.",,,,
"The differentiation trend in the consumption of goods and services has once again become prominent. The growth momentum of commodity retail sales is insufficient, and automobiles have become the biggest drag. Total retail sales of consumer goods fell by 0.8 percentage points year-on-year to 2.3% in April. The following three characteristics are present: 1) The year-on-year growth rate of commodity retail sales dropped again by 0.7 percentage points to 2.0%. Since the beginning of the year, housing prices have accelerated their decline again, significantly dragging down residents’ willingness to consume goods, especially optional goods. 2) The year-on-year growth rate of catering retail sales only fell slightly by 2.5 percentage points to 4.4% against the background of a high base. The cooling rate was much smaller than that of commodities. The trend of accelerating differentiation in consumption of commodities and services since the beginning of the year has been confirmed again. 3) The growth momentum of retail sales of goods above designated size, which is concentrated on durable optional goods, dropped sharply by 1.6 percentage points year-on-year to only 0.9% in April. Among them, the year-on-year decline of automobiles expanded by 1.9 percentage points to -5.6%, which was 14 lowest level since last month.",,,,
"The growth rate of fixed asset investment has slowed down, financing has stagnated, infrastructure investment has fallen sharply, and real estate investment has hovered at a low level. In April, the growth rate of fixed asset investment fell by 1.3 percentage points year-on-year to 3.5%. The growth rates of the three major types of investment slowed down simultaneously. Infrastructure investment suffered the most from the constraints of slow financing and the cooling of the internal dynamic energy of enterprises. The decline in real estate development investment expanded again by 0.5 percentage points to -10.5%. The year-on-year growth rate of manufacturing investment dropped slightly by 1.2 percentage points to 9.2%, but the growth rate was still higher than that for the whole of 2023, and the actual growth rate remained high. The growth rate of broad-based infrastructure investment dropped sharply by 4.3 percentage points to 7.7%. In addition to the high base, it was also due to the slow issuance of government bonds since the beginning of the year, the suspension of infrastructure projects in some provinces in the central and western regions, and the slowdown of enterprises in the power energy, information transmission and other industries. The cooling of borrowing and endogenous investment momentum is closely related. The Politburo meeting at the end of April called for accelerating the issuance and use of special bonds, and the first batch of ultra-long-term special government bonds has also been issued, which is expected to provide some support for the growth of infrastructure investment in the second half of the year.",,,,
"The year-on-year decline in residential sales area expanded again to a new low since 2023 as the base increased, and the year-on-year decline in newly started and completed area narrowed in a single month. In April, the year-on-year declines in newly started residential area and completed area narrowed 11.0 and 8.5 percentage points respectively to -15.3% and -16.9%. However, the year-on-year decline in sales area, which has a more long-term trend, expanded again by 3.2 percentage points against the backdrop of the base reaching its peak. percentage points to -25.1%. Since the end of April and the beginning of May, many cities have implemented a new round of policy relaxation in terms of increasing housing provident fund limits and easing purchase restrictions. However, judging from high-frequency transaction data, the real estate market has not shown obvious signs of improvement. At present, my country\'s real estate market may have entered the """"stock equilibrium"""" stage. The population and industrial layout issues in the long term are the most important influencing factors. It is difficult for policy relaxation in the short term to have an immediate stimulating effect.",,,,
"The accelerated destocking phase has come to an end, and industrial added value has rebounded modestly year-on-year. Whether this can be maintained in the future still depends on the progress and intensity of the recovery in demand for industrial products. The industrial added value in April rebounded by 2.2 percentage points to 6.7% year-on-year in March, and the mining, manufacturing, and public utilities sectors increased by 1.8, 2.4, and 0.9 percentage points year-on-year to 2%, 7.5%, and 5.8% respectively. In the context of the United States\' """"decoupling and disconnection"""" policy towards China that has intensified and spread further to the new energy automobile industry, it is accelerating the construction of new productive forces, increasing investment in advanced industries, and implementing greater subsidies through the replacement of old consumer goods with new ones. Promoting domestic demand is the foundation of my country\'s advanced industrial chain.",,,,
"Domestic demand for consumption and investment has weakened simultaneously, and the key to policy is for the central government to increase expansion efforts and speed up implementation. At present, my country\'s economy shows three major structural characteristics in terms of domestic demand: First, the real estate market is affected by long-term factors such as demographic structure and tilted industrial layout, which has led to a huge differentiation in housing price-to-income ratios. It is difficult to see a balanced bottom for supply and demand adjustment in the short term, which not only drags down investment. , and the continued decline in housing prices and the accelerated deleveraging of residents have inhibited residents\' willingness to consume optional goods. Second, local debt risks are being resolved at an accelerated pace. In addition, the endogenous investment demand of enterprises such as the power energy and information transmission industries has naturally slowed down after high growth for more than one year. Ultra-long-term special government bonds are urgently needed for infrastructure investment. The issuance of additional government bonds in 2023 will be accelerated to form a physical workload. Support is relatively high. Third, residents\' service consumption demand has good resilience and growth stickiness, and is expected to grow relatively steadily, which will continue to diverge from the trend of commodity consumption. Against this background, increasing the central fiscal expansion and accelerating the formation of effective policy stimulus are the key policies for high-quality economic development this year. Relevant fiscal policies such as the issuance and use of special bonds, the implementation of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds, large-scale equipment updates and consumer goods trade-in expenditures have all been accelerated in May, and are expected to play an important role in promoting infrastructure investment and residents\' consumption of durable optional goods. After the European Central Bank started to cut interest rates in June, there is a risk that the U.S. dollar index will surge again and impose greater external constraints on the People\'s Bank of China\'s monetary easing operations. Monetary policy during the year is expected to be mainly oriented to actively cooperate with fiscal expansion rather than radically stimulate investment, maintaining the September rate cut. The predictions that the full-year 1Y LPR/MLF interest rate will be cut by 30 BP and that the 5Y LPR will not be cut again remain unchanged.",,,,
Risk warning: The risk of government bond issuance being slower than expected; the risk of fiscal expansion policy being less effective than expected.,,,,
Peaceful perspective:,,,,
"New social financing is still mainly driven by government bonds. In December 2023, new social financing increased year-on-year, and the year-on-year growth rate of social financing stock increased by 0.1 percentage points to 9.5%. Among the main sub-items: 1) Net government debt financing is the most important support, driving the year-on-year growth rate of social financing to increase by 0.18 percentage points compared with the previous month; 2) RMB credit as the main part is weaker than the same period last year, which is a drag on new social financing More than 0.1 percentage point; 3) Direct corporate financing has been slightly driven, mainly driven by the low base of sluggish corporate bond issuance in the same period last year; 4) Off-balance sheet financing continues the previous trend and has a relatively limited impact on new social financing.",,,,
"Demand for medium- and long-term corporate loans weakened. In December 2023, new RMB loans increased by more than 200 billion yuan year-on-year; the growth rate of loan stock fell by 0.2 percentage points year-on-year to 10.6%. Among them, corporate medium and long-term loans are a drag, which can basically explain the decline in RMB loan growth. There are two reasons: on the one hand, the additional government bond issuance project has not yet been """"continued"""", and the demand for medium and long-term loans for infrastructure construction is not strong. According to incomplete statistics from Mysteel, in December 2023, the year-on-year growth rate of investment in major projects nationwide was only -34%. On the other hand, manufacturing loan demand continues to weaken. The manufacturing PMI data is basically in sync with the related loan demand index. In December 2023, it was only 49, falling for three consecutive months and below the boom-bust line.",,,,
"In terms of money supply and deposits: 1) The vitality of the corporate sector is still insufficient. In December 2023, M1\'s year-on-year growth rate remained unchanged at 1.3%, still at the lowest level since monthly statistics were collected in 1996 (excluding January data, which was greatly affected by the Spring Festival). On the one hand, the corporate sector is operating under pressure and has insufficient cash inflows. In December 2023, new corporate deposits were approximately 316.5 billion yuan, the second lowest for the same period since 2009. On the other hand, corporate time deposits maintained growth, but demand deposits continued to decline. At a time when the economic recovery slope is relatively limited, the corporate sector is pursuing more deterministic returns, exacerbating the decline of corporate demand deposits. 2) The year-on-year growth rate of M2 fell back. In December 2023, the year-on-year growth rate of M2 fell by 0.3 percentage points from the previous month, and the growth rate of RMB loans fell by 0.2 percentage points during the same period, which was dragged down by the slowdown in credit expansion.",,,,
"Social financing credit will show the following characteristics in 2023: First, government debt financing was weak in the first half of the year, but continued to push up social financing in the second half, contributing nearly 70% to the year-on-year increase in social financing throughout the year. Second, on-balance sheet loans were strong in the first four months, and then fell back, contributing approximately 45% to the year-on-year increase in social financing throughout the year. Among the sub-categories, corporate mid- and long-term loans were generally strong, but gradually fell back in the second half of the year; residents\' mid- and long-term loans were slightly weaker than the same period last year, matching the real estate sales situation; the base of residents\' short-term loans was low, and the base of corporate short-term loans was high. Expanding steadily, the two also contributed relative increments. In addition, on-balance sheet bill financing has shrunk significantly year-on-year, benefiting from the relatively stable demand for credit financing, the weakening demand for bank bill discount momentum, and the impact of the implementation of new bill regulations. Third, off-balance sheet financing maintained an increase, but did not offset the decline in corporate direct financing. It can be seen from the changes in the incremental structure of social financing that the recovery momentum of China\'s economy in 2023 was strong in the first quarter and dropped significantly in the second quarter. Although corporate financing weakened in the third and fourth quarters, the government departments\' """"increased leverage"""" to support the bottom line has increased, and the economic recovery momentum has remained relatively stable. Looking forward to 2024, considering that the trend recovery of the real estate industry will still take time, and there is certain uncertainty in the pace and slope of export recovery, the boost of economic growth momentum still depends on the """"continuation"""" of government debt financing. Specifically, by the first quarter of 2024, considering the window guidance of smooth credit issuance and the pace of preparation for early approval of local government debt is slightly weaker than that of the same period in 2023, the growth rate of social financing may face certain downward pressure.",,,,
Key point 1: Why is the GDP growth target set at around 5%?,,,,
Focus 2: Issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds to offset the slowdown in general budget expenditure growth.,,,,
"Key point 3: Monetary policy continues the tone of the monetary policy report, focusing on structure and stock.",,,,
Key point 4: The stability of the capital market needs to be strengthened.,,,,
Key Point 5: The determination to promote development through reform is still strong.,,,,
Key point 6: The priority of rejuvenating the country through science and education has been raised.,,,,
Focus 7: Which industries will receive key support?,,,,
"Key point 8: Propose """"artificial intelligence +"""" and attach importance to the development of AI.",,,,
Key point 9: Incentives for private capital to participate in scientific and technological innovation may be increased.,,,,
Key point 10: New urbanization + land reform may be the focus of this year’s reform.,,,,
Risk warning: There is uncertainty in the pace of policy; overseas political and economic fluctuations may have an impact on the introduction of policies.,,,,
"In the second quarter of 2024, the global economy was more resilient than expected and inflation levels tended to decline. Residential consumption has improved, private investment and government spending have come under pressure, and aggregate demand has remained stable. The primary and secondary industries have steadily rebounded, the tertiary industry has continued to perform well, and the total supply has improved significantly. Global trade is recovering steadily, and trade in goods has become an important driving force. Global fiscal policy has returned to normal, and monetary policy adjustments have become more differentiated. The foreign exchange market fluctuated violently, global stock markets fell first and then rose, and commodity prices were supported.",,,,
"Looking forward to the third quarter of 2024, global economic growth will continue the performance in the second quarter, and may show a slight adjustment in aggregate demand and a recovery in aggregate supply. The growth rate of private consumption may slow down, private investment will gradually bottom out, and global trade is likely to continue its recovery trend. Global inflation continues to fall, but recurring risks remain. Central banks around the world will start cutting interest rates one after another, liquidity supply is generally stable, and the geopolitical risk premium in the commodity market is expected to decline.",,,,
Hot issues such as the practical characteristics and impact of the EU’s Foreign Subsidies Regulation and the impact of the 2024 US election on macro policies deserve attention.,,,,
"In order to thoroughly implement the relevant arrangements of the Central Financial Work Conference and the new """"Nine Articles of the Nation"""", Wu Qing, Secretary and Chairman of the Party Committee of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, recently held a symposium on the """"Five Big Articles"""" for the capital market to do a good job in finance, and discussed technology finance, green finance, and general finance. Representatives of enterprises, institutions, experts and scholars in the fields of welfare finance, pension finance, digital finance and other fields had in-depth exchanges and fully listened to opinions and suggestions. Li Chao, member of the Party Committee and Vice Chairman of the meeting, attended At the symposium, everyone believed that doing a good job in the """"five major articles"""" of finance is an important focus for the capital market to better serve China-style modernization. The capital market has important functions such as sharing innovation risks, promoting the formation of innovative capital, and optimizing resource allocation. It must continue to work hard on the """"five major articles"""" of finance. Adhere to the direction of marketization and rule of law, further comprehensively deepen the capital market reform, improve the functions of the capital market, continuously improve the product and service system, and guide more resources to gather in areas such as technological innovation, green and low carbon, and inclusive people\'s livelihood. Wu Qing pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has conscientiously implemented the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, focusing on the article of science and technology finance, and has issued a series of policy documents such as the """"Sixteen Articles of Science and Technology Innovation"""" and the """"Eight Articles of Science and Technology Innovation Board"""" , currently working hard to promote the implementation of various measures At the same time, we actively and steadily promote the optimization of relevant systems and product innovation involving the capital market such as green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance, and digital finance. Wu Qing emphasized that doing a good job in the """"five major articles"""" of finance is not only an urgent need to promote high-quality development, but also an important part of effectively improving the quality and efficiency of financial services to the real economy, and the capital market has an unshirkable responsibility In the next step, the China Securities Regulatory Commission will thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important expositions on financial work and the spirit of the National Science and Technology Conference, closely focus on the “five major articles” of finance, adhere to systematic thinking, integrity and innovation, comprehensive policies, and according to the characteristics of the capital market We should identify the key points and breakthrough points according to law, accelerate the reform and improvement of relevant basic systems and mechanisms, and provide higher-quality products and services for major strategies, key areas, and weak links in economic and social development. Further improve the inclusiveness and precision of the capital market in supporting technological innovation, take multiple measures to activate the M&A and restructuring market, promote private equity and venture capital funds to play a better role, improve the multi-level market system of stocks, bonds, futures, etc., and continue to promote the high level of the capital market. Quality development to better serve the development of new quality productive forces and Chinese-style modernization Responsible comrades from relevant departments and bureaus of the China Securities Regulatory Commission attended the forum",,,,
